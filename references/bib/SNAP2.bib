  abstract = {Background: Despite evidence of high activity, the number of surgical procedures performed in UK hospitals, their cost and subsequent mortality remain unclear.Methods: Time-trend ecological study using hospital episode data from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The primary outcome was the number of in-hospital procedures, grouped using three increasingly specific categories of surgery. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay and healthcare costs according to standard National Health Service tariffs.Results: Between April 1, 2009 and March 31, 2014, 39 631 801 surgical patient episodes were recorded. There was an annual average of 7 926 360 procedures (inclusive category), 5 104 165 procedures (intermediate category) and 1 526 421 procedures (restrictive category). This equates to 12 537, 8073 and 2414 procedures per 100 000 population per year, respectively. On average there were 85 181 deaths (1.1\%) within 30 days of a procedure each year, rising to 178 040 deaths (2.3\%) after 90 days. Approximately 62.8\% of all procedures were day cases. Median length of stay for in-patient procedures was 1.7 (1.3\textendash 2.0) days. The total cost of surgery over the 5 yr period was \textsterling 54.6 billion (\$104.4 billion), representing an average annual cost of \textsterling 10.9 billion (inclusive), \textsterling 9.5 billion (intermediate) and \textsterling 5.6 billion (restrictive). For each category, the number of procedures increased each year, while mortality decreased. One-third of all mortalities in national death registers occurred within 90 days of a procedure (inclusive category).Conclusions: The number of surgical procedures in the UK varies widely according to definition. The number of procedures is slowly increasing whilst the number of deaths is decreasing.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between intraoperative cardiovascular changes and perioperative myocardial injury has chiefly focused on hypotension during noncardiac surgery. However, the relative influence of blood pressure and heart rate (HR) remains unclear. We investigated both individual and codependent relationships among intraoperative HR, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS). METHODS: Secondary analysis of the Vascular Events in Noncardiac Surgery Cohort Evaluation (VISION) study, a prospective international cohort study of noncardiac surgical patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis tested for associations between intraoperative HR and/or SBP and MINS, defined by an elevated serum troponin T adjudicated as due to an ischemic etiology, within 30 days after surgery. Predefined thresholds for intraoperative HR and SBP were: maximum HR {$>$}100 beats or minimum HR {$<$}55 beats per minute (bpm); maximum SBP {$>$}160 mm Hg or minimum SBP {$<$}100 mm Hg. Secondary outcomes were myocardial infarction and mortality within 30 days after surgery. RESULTS: After excluding missing data, 1197 of 15,109 patients (7.9\%) sustained MINS, 454 of 16,031 (2.8\%) sustained myocardial infarction, and 315 of 16,061 patients (2.0\%) died within 30 days after surgery. Maximum intraoperative HR {$>$}100 bpm was associated with MINS (odds ratio [OR], 1.27 [1.07\textendash 1.50]; P {$<$} .01), myocardial infarction (OR, 1.34 [1.05\textendash 1.70]; P = .02), and mortality (OR, 2.65 [2.06\textendash 3.41]; P {$<$} .01). Minimum SBP {$<$}100 mm Hg was associated with MINS (OR, 1.21 [1.05\textendash 1.39]; P = .01) and mortality (OR, 1.81 [1.39\textendash 2.37]; P {$<$} .01), but not myocardial infarction (OR, 1.21 [0.98\textendash 1.49]; P = .07). Maximum SBP {$>$}160 mm Hg was associated with MINS (OR, 1.16 [1.01\textendash 1.34]; P = .04) and myocardial infarction (OR, 1.34 [1.09\textendash 1.64]; P = .01) but, paradoxically, reduced mortality (OR, 0.76 [0.58\textendash 0.99]; P = .04). Minimum HR {$<$}55 bpm was associated with reduced MINS (OR, 0.70 [0.59\textendash 0.82]; P {$<$} .01), myocardial infarction (OR, 0.75 [0.58\textendash 0.97]; P = .03), and mortality (OR, 0.58 [0.41\textendash 0.81]; P {$<$} .01). Minimum SBP {$<$}100 mm Hg with maximum HR {$>$}100 bpm was more strongly associated with MINS (OR, 1.42 [1.15\textendash 1.76]; P {$<$} .01) compared with minimum SBP {$<$}100 mm Hg alone (OR, 1.20 [1.03\textendash 1.40]; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative tachycardia and hypotension are associated with MINS. Further interventional research targeting HR/blood pressure is needed to define the optimum strategy to reduce MINS.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To report rates of and reasons for operation cancellation, and to prioritize areas of improvement. METHODS: Retrospective data were extracted from the monthly reports of cancelled listed operations. Data on 14 theatres were collected by the office of quality assurance at Jordan University Hospital from August 2012 to April 2016. Rates and reasons for operation cancellation were investigated. A Pareto chart was constructed to identify the reasons of highest priority. RESULTS: During the period of study, 6,431 cases (9.31\%) were cancelled out of 69,066 listed cases. Patient no-shows accounted for 62.52\% of cancellations. A Pareto analysis showed that around 80\% of the known reasons for cancellation after admission were due to a lack of surgical theatre time (30\%), incomplete preoperative assessment (21\%), upper respiratory tract infection (19\%), and high blood pressure (13\%). CONCLUSION: This study identified the most common reasons for operation cancellation at a teaching hospital. Potential avoidable root causes and recommended interventions were suggested accordingly. Future research, available resources, hospital policies, and strategic measures directed to tackle these reasons should take priority.},

  abstract = {Background Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways has been shown to minimize the duration of hospital stay. The aim of this study was to identify which factors have the greatest impact at reducing the length of stay within an enhanced recovery programme. Methods A retrospective case note review of patients undergoing open elective colorectal resections between August 2007 and May 2009 was performed. Data on numerous pre, peri and postoperative variables were collected. Postoperative complications, readmissions, length of stay and fitness for discharge were recorded. Using logistic regression analysis, univariate and multivariate analysis of predictors for a shorter hospital stay was performed. Odd ratios and ninety-five percent confidence intervals were calculated and a p-value of less than 0.05 was significant. Results There were 231 patients, of which 130 were female. Median age was 68 (IQR 56\textendash 76) years. Median length of stay was 6 (IQR 5\textendash 9) days. On multivariate analysis, ASA grade (OR 2.85 (95\%CI 1.17\textendash 6.89), p~=~0.040), the avoidance of oral opiates in the postoperative period (OR 0.39 (95\%CI 0.18\textendash 0.84), p~=~0.016) and the duration of use of epidurals for postoperative analgesia (OR 0.44 (95\%CI 0.12\textendash 0.94), p~=~0.023) were found to be significant predictors of reduced hospital stay. Conclusion Lower ASA grade, use of epidurals and avoidance of regular oral opiates are associated with an earlier discharge in an ERAS programme.},

When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure.

It is particularly relevant to the perioperative period, during which patients are subject to high levels of stress and inflammation. This review aims to familiarize the anesthesiologist with the most current concepts regarding frailty and its emerging role in preoperative assessment and risk stratification. Recent findings Current literature has established frailty as a significant predictor of operative complications, institutionalization, and death among elderly surgical patients. A variety of scoring systems have been proposed to preoperatively identify and assess frail patients, though they differ in their clinical utility and prognostic ability. Additionally, evidence suggests an evolving potential for preoperative intervention and modification of the frailty syndrome. Summary The elderly are medically complex and heterogeneous with respect to operative risk. Recent advances in the concept of frailty provide an evidence-based framework to guide the anesthesiologist in the perioperative management, evaluation, and risk stratification of older surgical patients.},

  abstract = {The effect of class size on student achievement has long been of concern to educators, parents, and scholars. In Israeli public schools today, class size is partly determined using a rule proposed by Maimonides in the 12th century. This rule induces a nonlinear and non-monotonic relationship between enroll- ment size and class size. We use this relationship to construct instrumental variables estimates of the effect of class size on the test scores of Israeli 4th and 5th graders in 1991 and 3rd graders in 1992. Because the up-and-down pattern in class size induced by Maimonides' rule matches a similar pattern in test scores, the rule provides a credible source of exogenous variation for investigation of the causal effect of class size on student achievement. Our use of Maimonides' rule can be viewed as an application of Campbell's (1969) regression-discontinuity design to the class size question. The results of this application show that reductions in class size induce a significant increase in reading and math scores for 5th graders and a smaller increase in reading scores for 4th graders. In contrast, there is little evidence of any association between class size and the test scores of 3rd graders, although this finding may result from problems with the 1992 wave of the testing program. The estimates also suggest that the gains from small classes are largest for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Besides being of metho- dological interest and providing new evidence on the class size question, these findings are of immediate policy interest in Israel where legislation to reduce the maximum class size is pending.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The operating theatre (OT) is a vital facility that utilises a considerable portion of the hospital's budget; thus proper OT utilisation is essential. Surgical cancellation is a leading cause of OT underutilisation. This study aimed to report the rate and reasons for surgical cancellations and no-shows in a large regional hospital in Oman. METHODS: This study took place as part of a retrospective quality management project at the Ibri Regional Hospital, Ibri, Oman. All elective surgical procedures scheduled between January and December 2014 were included. Cancelled procedures were reviewed to determine the reasons for cancellation. RESULTS: A total of 4,814 elective procedures were scheduled during the study period; of these, 1,235 (26\%) were cancelled. Patient no-shows were the most prevalent reason for surgical cancellation (63\%), followed by surgical reasons (17\%); in contrast, OT-associated reasons were responsible for only 2\% of cancellations. According to speciality, general surgery had the highest percentage of total cancellations (65\%), while ear, nose and throat had the highest rate of surgical cancellations among their scheduled cases (42\%). CONCLUSION: Ibri Regional Hospital had a higher surgical cancellation rate due to no-shows than those reported in the literature. Regular audits, quality management projects and the appointment of a dedicated procedure booking coordinator may enhance proper utilisation of the OT, potentially saving funds, conserving resources and alleviating the burden of cancellations.},

These deaths (n~=~119; 15\%) were further analysed to identify contributing aspects of the anaesthetic management, other factors and the appropriateness of care. The incidence of 24-h peri-operative death per 10~000 anaesthetics was 8.8 (95\% CI 8.2\textendash 9.5), of peri-operative coma was 0.5 (0.3\textendash 0.6) and of anaesthesia-related death 1.4 (1.1\textendash 1.6).

Inadequate preparation of the patient contributed to 30 (25\%) of the anaesthesia-related deaths. During induction of anaesthesia, choice of anaesthetic technique (n~=~18 (15\%)) and performance of the anaesthesiologist (n~=~8 (7\%)) were most commonly associated with death.

This approach is compared with models that ignore the hierarchy, and models in which the hierarchy is represented by a fixed parameter for each cluster. It is shown, by simulation, that simple models with dummy variables outperform both random effect models and models ignoring the hierarchy in terms of balance of cluster-level unobserved covariates and omitted variable bias. The representation of the clusters by fixed or random effects defines a model more general than would be ideal if the relevant cluster-level variables were available. The general conclusion confirms that when conducting propensity score analysis it is safer to specify a more general model than pursuing model parsimony.},

  abstract = {The propensity score is a subject's probability of treatment, conditional on observed baseline covariates. Conditional on the true propensity score, treated and untreated subjects have similar distributions of observed baseline covariates. Propensity-score matching is a popular method of using the propensity score in the medical literature. Using this approach, matched sets of treated and untreated subjects with similar values of the propensity score are formed. Inferences about treatment effect made using propensity-score matching are valid only if, in the matched sample, treated and untreated subjects have similar distributions of measured baseline covariates. In this paper we discuss the following methods for assessing whether the propensity score model has been correctly specified: comparing means and prevalences of baseline characteristics using standardized differences; ratios comparing the variance of continuous covariates between treated and untreated subjects; comparison of higher order moments and interactions; five-number summaries; and graphical methods such as quantile\textendash quantile plots, side-by-side boxplots, and non-parametric density plots for comparing the distribution of baseline covariates between treatment groups. We describe methods to determine the sampling distribution of the standardized difference when the true standardized difference is equal to zero, thereby allowing one to determine the range of standardized differences that are plausible with the propensity score model having been correctly specified. We highlight the limitations of some previously used methods for assessing the adequacy of the specification of the propensity-score model. In particular, methods based on comparing the distribution of the estimated propensity score between treated and untreated subjects are uninformative.

In many-to-one (M:1) matching on the propensity score, M untreated subjects are matched to each treated subject using the propensity score. The authors used Monte Carlo simulations to examine the effect of the choice of M on the statistical performance of matched estimators. They considered matching 1\textendash 5 untreated subjects to each treated subject using both nearest-neighbor matching and caliper matching in 96 different scenarios. Increasing the number of untreated subjects matched to each treated subject tended to increase the bias in the estimated treatment effect; conversely, increasing the number of untreated subjects matched to each treated subject decreased the sampling variability of the estimated treatment effect. Using nearest-neighbor matching, the mean squared error of the estimated treatment effect was minimized in 67.7\% of the scenarios when 1:1 matching was used. Using nearest-neighbor matching or caliper matching, the mean squared error was minimized in approximately 84\% of the scenarios when, at most, 2 untreated subjects were matched to each treated subject. The authors recommend that, in most settings, researchers match either 1 or 2 untreated subjects to each treated subject when using propensity-score matching.},

When controlled for various vital signs and demographics, objective signs lose their explanatory power. LOS and death are more associated with physicians' early subjective risk assessments than the objective measures.

It is uncertain how different scheduling rules affect the rate of elective surgery cancellations. Methods We used discrete event simulation modelling to represent perioperative processes at a hospital in Toronto, Canada. We tested the effects of the following 3 scenarios on the number of surgical cancellations: scheduling surgeons' operating days based on their patients' average length of stay in hospital, sequencing surgical procedures by average duration and variance, and increasing the number of post-surgical ward beds. Results The number of elective cancellations was reduced by scheduling surgeons whose patients had shorter average lengths of stay in hospital earlier in the week, sequencing shorter surgeries and those with less variance in duration earlier in the day, and by adding up to 2 additional beds to the postsurgical ward. Conclusion Discrete event simulation modelling can be used to develop strategies for improving efficiency in operating rooms.},

This has prompted hospital initiatives to increase patient flow and minimize nonvalue added care time. Real-time demand capacity management (RTDC) is one such initiative whereby clinicians convene each morning to predict patients able to leave the same day and prioritize their remaining tasks for early discharge. Our objective is to automate and improve these discharge predictions by applying supervised machine learning methods to readily available health information.Materials and Methods The authors use supervised machine learning methods to predict patients' likelihood of discharge by 2 p.m. and by midnight each day for an inpatient medical unit. Using data collected over 8000 patient stays and 20 000 patient days, the predictive performance of the model is compared to clinicians using sensitivity, specificity, Youden's Index (i.e., sensitivity + specificity \textendash{} 1), and aggregate accuracy measures.Results The model compared to clinician predictions demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity (P {$<$} .01), lower specificity (P {$<$} .01), and a comparable Youden Index (P {$>$} .10). Early discharges were less predictable than midnight discharges. The model was more accurate than clinicians in predicting the total number of daily discharges and capable of ranking patients closest to future discharge.Conclusions There is potential to use readily available health information to predict daily patient discharges with accuracies comparable to clinician predictions. This approach may be used to automate and support daily RTDC predictions aimed at improving patient flow.},

  abstract = {It was noted that a number of patients were having their procedures cancelled on the day of surgery because their antiplatelet or anticoagulative medications had not been stopped preoperatively. The team recognised that this problem was leading to an unnecessary waste of the department`s labour and financial resources, and more importantly was becoming a source of disappointment and anxiety to patients. A retrospective analysis of all plastic surgery cases was performed for procedures listed for the previous 12 months. All cancellations and the reasons for them were recorded, which came to 23 cases. The sum of the financial tariffs for each cancelled procedure was calculated to assess the financial impact of the identified problem: \textsterling 20,000. A root cause analysis was performed to assess where this problem was arising in the patient's preoperative journey. The common theme was the lack of information for the gatekeeper regarding the patients' anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications. A new gatekeeper form was introduced to practice with a subsection specifically highlighting antiplatelet and anticoagulative medications. In addition, this issue was highlighted to the relevant staff in the department. After four months, a second PDSA cycle was performed in the same manner. Seven cases were cancelled due to anticoagulants or antiplatelets not being stopped prior to surgery. This equated to a net loss of \textsterling 11,865 to the department when projected over 12 months, improving on the performance prior to the newly introduced changes.},

We're all laboring under our own and society's expectations to be perfect in every way-to look younger, to make more money, to be happy all the time. But according to Tal Ben-Shahar, the New York Times bestselling author of Happier, the pursuit of perfect may actually be the number-one internal obstacle to finding happiness. OR DO YOU WANT TO BE HAPPY? Applying cutting-edge research in the field of positive psychology-the scientific principles taught in his wildly popular course at Harvard University-Ben-Shahar takes us off the impossible pursuit of perfection and directs us to the way to happiness, richness, and true fulfillment. He shows us the freedom derived from not trying to do it all right all the time and the real lessons that failure and painful emotions can teach us. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE PERFECT TO BE PERFECTLY HAPPY!  In The Pursuit of Perfect, Tal Ben-Shahar offers an optimal way of thinking about failure and success--and the very way we live. He provides exercises for self reflection, meditations, and ``Time-Ins'' to help you rediscover what you really want out of life. Praise for Tal Ben-Shahar's Happier: ``This fine book shimmers with a rare brand of good sense that is embedded in scientific knowledge about how to increase happiness. It is easy to see how this is the backbone of the most popular course at Harvard today.''  -Martin E. P. Seligman, author of Authentic Happiness},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cancellations of planned elective surgical operations increase financial cost to the patient and the hospital. OBJECTIVES: To determine the rate and reasons for cancellations, estimate the cost incurred by such cancellations and recommend possible solutions. METHODS: We did a prospective descriptive study of cancellations of elective general surgical operations over the 1-year period January~- December 2014 in the main theatre at Pietersburg (PTB) Hospital, Limpopo Province, South Africa. All patients listed on the theatre booking slate for elective general surgical operations before the cut-off time of 13h00 on the day before the anticipated operation were included. Epi Infoversion 7 was used to analyse the data and derive the descriptive statistics. RESULTS: There were 537 booked patients (median age 47 years, range 1 - 94); a total of 298 operations were performed, and 239 were cancelled (cancellation rate 44.5\%). Reasons for cancellation were as follows: theatre needed for an emergency n=154 (64.4\%), theatre equipment failure and lack of consumables n=17 (7.1\%), non-theatre equipment failure n=10 (4.2\%), prolonged time of operations n=13 (5.4\%), abnormal blood results n=8 (3.3\%), patient comorbidity and poor general condition n=9 (3.8\%), patients absent from the ward n=8 (3.3\%), patients not starved n=2 (0.8\%), patients' condition improved significantly n=3 (1.3\%), nurses' strike n=5 (2.1\%), rebooking of cases for senior surgeons or other specialty n=2 (0.8\%), and other reasons n=8 (3.3\%). The cost per inpatient per day was estimated at ZAR4 890 at PTB Hospital and ZAR2 100 at district hospitals, and the total cost per cancelled operation was ZAR25 860. CONCLUSIONS: Over the 1-year period 44.5\% of elective operations at PTB Hospital were cancelled, 64.4\% because the theatre was needed for an emergency operation. We recommend that a theatre dedicated to emergencies be opened at PTB Hospital. The cost incurred due to cancellations was about ZAR6 million for the hospital, with additional cost and emotional trauma for the patients.},

  abstract = {Background Accurately estimating surgical risks is critical for shared decision making and informed consent. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services may soon put forth a measure requiring surgeons to provide patients with patient-specific, empirically derived estimates of postoperative complications. Our objectives were to develop a universal surgical risk estimation tool, to compare performance of the universal vs previous procedure-specific surgical risk calculators, and to allow surgeons to empirically adjust the estimates of risk. Study Design Using standardized clinical data from 393 ACS NSQIP hospitals, a web-based tool was developed to allow surgeons to easily enter 21 preoperative factors (demographics, comorbidities, procedure). Regression models were developed to predict 8 outcomes based on the preoperative risk factors. The universal model was compared with procedure-specific models. To incorporate surgeon input, a subjective surgeon adjustment score, allowing risk estimates to vary within the estimate's confidence interval, was introduced and tested with 80 surgeons using 10 case scenarios. Results Based on 1,414,006 patients encompassing 1,557 unique CPT codes, a universal surgical risk calculator model was developed that had excellent performance for mortality (c-statistic~= 0.944; Brier score~= 0.011 [where scores approaching 0 are better]), morbidity (c-statistic~= 0.816, Brier score~= 0.069), and 6 additional complications (c-statistics {$>$} 0.8). Predictions were similarly robust for the universal calculator vs procedure-specific calculators (eg, colorectal). Surgeons demonstrated considerable agreement on the case scenario scoring (80\% to 100\% agreement), suggesting reliable score assignment between surgeons. Conclusions The ACS NSQIP surgical risk calculator is a decision-support tool based on reliable multi-institutional clinical data, which can be used to estimate the risks of most operations. The ACS NSQIP surgical risk calculator will allow clinicians and patients to make decisions using empirically derived, patient-specific postoperative risks.},

Triage requires careful weighing of the benefits and risks involved in ICU admission while striving to guarantee fair distribution of available resources. We must ensure that the patients who occupy ICU beds are those most likely to benefit from the ICU's specialized technology and professionals. Although prognosticating is not an exact science, preference should be given to patients who are more likely to survive if admitted to the ICU but unlikely to survive or likely to have more significant morbidity if not admitted. To provide general guidance for intensivists in ICU triage decisions, a task force of the World Federation of Societies of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine addressed 4 basic questions regarding this process. The team made recommendations and concluded that triage should be led by intensivists considering input from nurses, emergency medicine professionals, hospitalists, surgeons, and allied professionals. Triage algorithms and protocols can be useful but can never supplant the role of skilled intensivists basing their decisions on input from multidisciplinary teams. Infrastructures need to be organized efficiently both within individual hospitals and at the regional level. When resources are critically limited, patients may be refused ICU admission if others may benefit more on the basis of the principle of distributive justice.},

As surgical innovations become more complex and the burden of age and comorbidities in the surgical patient population continues to increase, understanding the benefits and harms of surgical interventions becomes ever more important. Nevertheless, we can understand only what we can adequately describe. Truly collaborative decision-making, delivery of safe effective care, and on-going quality improvement are also critically dependent on reliable valid measurement of patient-relevant and clinically important data. Attempts to describe the full spectrum of outcomes following surgery necessarily entail moving beyond the traditional endpoints of mortality and resource use towards more complex measures of morbidity, patient-reported outcomes, and functional status. Without standardization and consensus to guide the use of increasingly complex and nuanced endpoints, there is a real risk that perioperative research will become embroiled in a mire of inconsistent heterogeneous outcome measures that cannot be meaningfully compared and contrasted between trials or combined within meta-analyses. This would result in limiting the value of the research effort and depriving patients and clinicians of definitive answers. Collaboration in perioperative medicine\textemdash whether between institutions or across continents\textemdash has enormous potential to improve the value of research output.

However, some are complex in clinical use and others have been developed using suboptimal methodology. The objective was to evaluate the capability of the staff at a medical admission unit (MAU) to use clinical intuition to predict in-hospital mortality of acutely admitted patients. Methods This is an observational prospective cohort study of adult patients (15 years or older) admitted to a MAU at a regional teaching hospital. The nursing staff and physicians predicted in-hospital mortality upon the patients' arrival. We calculated discriminatory power as the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC) and accuracy of prediction (calibration) by Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Results We had a total of 2,848 admissions (2,463 patients). 89 (3.1\%) died while admitted. The nursing staff assessed 2,404 admissions and predicted mortality in 1,820 (63.9\%). AUROC was 0.823 (95\% CI: 0.762\textendash 0.884) and calibration poor. Physicians assessed 738 admissions and predicted mortality in 734 (25.8\% of all admissions). AUROC was 0.761 (95\% CI: 0.657\textendash 0.864) and calibration poor. AUROC and calibration increased with experience. When nursing staff and physicians were in agreement ({$\pm$}5\%), discriminatory power was very high, 0.898 (95\% CI: 0.773\textendash 1.000), and calibration almost perfect. Combining an objective risk prediction score with staff predictions added very little. Conclusions Using only clinical intuition, staff in a medical admission unit has a good ability to identify patients at increased risk of dying while admitted. When nursing staff and physicians agreed on their prediction, discriminatory power and calibration were excellent.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Complication rates in complex spine surgery range from 25\% to 80\% in published studies. Numerous studies have shown that surgeons are not able to accurately predict whether patients are likely to face post-operative complications, in part due to biases based on individual experience. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a predictive risk model and decision support system that could accurately predict the likelihood of 30-day postoperative complications in complex spine surgery based on routinely measured preoperative variables. METHODS: Preoperative and postoperative data were collected for 136 patients by reviewing medical records. Logistic regression analysis (LRA) was applied to develop the predictive algorithm based on patient demographic parameters, including age, gender, and co-morbidities, including obesity, diabetes, hypertension and anemia. We additionally compared the performance of the predictive model to a spine surgeon's ability to predict patient complications using signal detection theory statistics representing sensitivity and response bias (A' and B{${''}$} respectively). We developed a decision support system tool, based on the LRA predictive algorithm, that was able to provide a numeric probabilistic likelihood statistic representing an individual patient's risk of developing a complication within the first 30days after surgery. RESULTS: The predictive model was significant ({$\chi$}2=16.242, p{$<$}0.05), showed good fit, and was calibrated by using area under the receiver operating characteristics curve analysis (AUROC=0.712, p{$<$}0.01). The model yielded a predictive accuracy of 75.0\%. It was validated by splitting the data set, comparing subset models, and testing them with unknown data. Validation also involved comparing the classification of cases by experts with the classification of cases by the model. The model significantly improved the classification accuracy of physicians involved in the delivery of complex spine surgical care. CONCLUSIONS: The application of technology and data-driven tools to advanced surgical practice has the potential to improve decision making quality, service quality and patient safety.},

  abstract = {The neuroendocrine, metabolic and inflammatory aspects of injury are part of the overall `stress response' (Table 1). This has been studied most commonly in relation to surgery, because the catabolic changes that occur can be observed from a well-defined starting point, but similar features occur in trauma, burns, severe infection and strenuous exercise. These result in substrate mobilization, muscle protein loss and sodium and water retention, with suppression of anabolic hormone secretion. There is activation of the sympathetic nervous system and immunological and haematological changes. Generally, the magnitude of the metabolic response is proportional to the severity of the surgical trauma. These changes have probably evolved to aid survival in a more primitive environment, by mobilizing substrates, limiting tissue damage, destroying infectious organisms and activating repair processes. Psychological and behavioural changes accompany the physiological events. The benefits of the stress response are not obvious in modern medicine, when physiological changes can be more easily corrected and it may even have a detrimental effect. In recent years, research has focused on methods to modify the response associated with surgery in an attempt to improve patient outcome.

In this, as in most other systems where taxes and/or insurances pay for most of the care, normal market forces are set aside at least in part. At times, this has, for example, resulted in long waiting lists, particularly in terms of elective orthopaedic surgery, with several negative consequences, such as cancellations of planned surgery.MethodsThe main purpose of this retrospective observational single center study was to evaluate and describe the number and reasons for cancellations in elective orthopaedic surgery. Studied were all the elective patients scheduled for joint replacement, arthroscopy and foot \& ankle surgery, January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2011, whose procedure was cancelled at least once.ResultsOf all 17,625 patients scheduled for elective surgery 6,911 (39\%) received at least one, some several cancellations. The most common reason for cancelling a planned surgery was different patient-related factors 3,293 (33\%). Cancellations due to treatment guarantee legislation reached 2,885 (29\%) and 1,181 (12\%) of the cancellations were related to incomplete pre-operative preparation of the patients. Organisational reasons were the cause of approximately 869 (9\%) of the cancellations.ConclusionsIn this study of patients waiting for elective orthopaedic surgery 6,911(39\%) had their surgical procedure cancelled at least once, some several times. It appears that it should be possible to eliminate many of these cancellations, while others are unavoidable or caused by factors outside the responsibility of the individual clinic or even hospital. One possible way of influencing the high rate of cancellations might be to change the view of the patients and involve them in the overall planning of the care process.},

Risk, or the chances that a hazard will give rise to harm,4 is generally couched in terms of numerical odds or probabilities (see table 1) yet research has shown that people find it difficult to digest such measures.5 One difficulty is that the range of risks is so wide\textemdash from, say, the greater than 1 in 10 risk that cancer will be our eventual cause of death to the less than 1 in 10 million chance per year of being killed by lightning. We all find it hard to grasp such extremes.

RESULTS: Of the 29,518 scheduled surgeries, 16.1\% were cancelled. The patient was the main reason, accounting for more than 40\% of all suspensions. When calculating the rate of surgery suspended from a specialty, dividing the number of cancelled surgeries in a specialty by the number of scheduled surgeries in the same, we found that otolaryngology is the specialty with the highest rate of 21.3\%. CONCLUSIONS: One of the main reasons in our sample why surgeries were cancelled is nonappearance of the patient. Improving communication between patient and hospital facilitates the client program and also contributes to avoid cancellations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The lack of consensus on how to define and grade adverse postoperative events has greatly hampered the evaluation of surgical procedures. A new classification of complications, initiated in 1992, was updated 5 years ago. It is based on the type of therapy needed to correct the complication. The principle of the classification was to be simple, reproducible, flexible, and applicable irrespective of the cultural background. The aim of the current study was to critically evaluate this classification from the perspective of its use in the literature, by assessing interobserver variability in grading complex complication scenarios and to correlate the classification grades with patients', nurses', and doctors' perception. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Reports from the literature using the classification system were systematically analyzed. Next, 11 scenarios illustrating difficult cases were prepared to develop a consensus on how to rank the various complications. Third, 7 centers from different continents, having routinely used the classification, independently assessed the 11 scenarios. An agreement analysis was performed to test the accuracy and reliability of the classification. Finally, the perception of the severity was tested in patients, nurses, and physicians by presenting 30 scenarios, each illustrating a specific grade of complication. RESULTS: We noted a dramatic increase in the use of the classification in many fields of surgery. About half of the studies used the contracted form, whereas the rest used the full range of grading. Two-thirds of the publications avoided subjective terms such as minor or major complications. The study of 11 difficult cases among various centers revealed a high degree of agreement in identifying and ranking complications (89\% agreement), and enabled a better definition of unclear situations. Each grade of complications significantly correlated with the perception by patients, nurses, and physicians (P {$<$} 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test). CONCLUSIONS: This 5-year evaluation provides strong evidence that the classification is valid and applicable worldwide in many fields of surgery. No modification in the general principle of classification is warranted in view of the use in ongoing publications and trials. Subjective, inaccurate, or confusing terms such as "minor or major" should be removed from the surgical literature.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification (ASA) and preoperative Functional Health Status (FHS) variables on risk-adjusted estimates of surgical quality and to assess whether classifications are inflated at some hospitals. BACKGROUND: ASA and FHS are influential in risk-adjusted comparisons of surgical quality. However, because ASA and FHS are subjective they can be inflated, making patients appear more ill than they actually are, and crediting hospitals for a sicker patient population. METHODS: We identified 28,751 colorectal surgery patients at 170 hospitals participating in the American College of Surgeon's National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) during 2006 to 2007. Logistic regression models were developed for morbidity and mortality with and without inclusion of ASA and FHS. Hospital quality rankings from the different models were compared. RESULTS: Morbidity and mortality rates were 24.3\% and 3.9\%, respectively. Percents of patients in ASA classes I through V were 3.3\%, 46.4\%, 41.5\%,8.3\%, and 0.7\% and that were independent or partially or totally dependent were 89.2\%, 7.2\%, and 3.6\%, respectively. Models that included ASA and FHS exhibited slightly better fit (Hosmer-Lemshow statistic) and discrimination(c-statistic) than models without both these variables, though magnitudes of differences were consistent with chance. There was inconsistent evidence for improper assignment of ASA and FHS. CONCLUSIONS: The small improvements in model quality when both ASA and FHS are present versus absent, suggest that they make a unique contribution to assessing severity of preoperative risk. With little indication that these subjective variables are subject to an important level of institutional bias, it is appropriate that they be used to assess risk-adjusted surgical quality. Periodic monitoring for inappropriate inflation of ASA status is warranted.},

  abstract = {Background The American College of Surgeons NSQIP offers a Surgical Risk Calculator (SRC) that provides detailed, patient-level, risk assessments for many adverse outcomes to surgeons, patients, and the general public. The SRC calculator was designed to help guide discussion and decisions by providing generally applicable (not hospital-specific) information about surgical risk using easily understood and broadly available preoperative variables. Although large, internal evaluations have shown that the SRC has good accuracy (model discrimination and calibration), external validations have been inconsistent and tend to favor a conclusion of inadequate performance. Study Design External studies, attempting to validate the SRC, were examined with respect to 3 design features: sample size (small samples reduce reliability), case-mix homogeneity (homogeneity reduces discrimination); and number of institutions providing data (few institutions reduces generalizability). The impact of each feature was then examined in several sets of simulation studies. Results Each of the 3 design features has the potential to act as an artifactual cause for apparent SRC predictive failure. In addition, demonstrations that SRC estimates are inferior to those from models that use additional (sometimes operation-specific) predictor variables were seen as not relevant with respect to the SRC's intended scope. Conclusions The SRC predictive failures, reported by studies with the described design limitations, should not be misunderstood as disqualifying the SRC as an accurate and appropriate tool for its intended purpose of providing a general purpose risk calculator, applicable across many surgical domains, using easily understood and generally available predictive information.},

Determining which factors increase LOS may provide information on reducing costs and improving the delivery of care. The purpose of this study was to determine the independent association of intraoperative process of care and postoperative events with prolonged LOS after adjusting for preoperative severity of illness in patients undergoing major elective surgery. Methods Cases representing 11 elective operations from the National VA Surgical Quality Improvement Program were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. The outcome, prolonged LOS, was defined as an LOS greater than or equal to the 75th percentile (in days) for each operation. Hierarchical modeling was used to assess the independent association of groups of variables (preoperative patient characteristics, intraoperative process of care, and postoperative adverse events) with prolonged LOS. Results For the 11 operations explored, there were 23,919 cases. Common preoperative variables associated with prolonged LOS were functional status, American Society of Anesthesiology class, and age. The most predictive intraoperative and postoperative variables included intraoperative blood transfusion, operative time, return to the operating room, and the number of complications after surgery. Conclusions Prolonged LOS is associated with preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors. Although preoperative factors were independently associated with a prolonged LOS, the factors generating the highest risks for a prolonged LOS were the intraoperative process of care and postoperative adverse events. To reduce costs, efforts should be made to improve the intraoperative process of care and to minimize postoperative complications.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) patient profiles and modifiers are descriptors of patient illness severity before durable ventricular assist device implantation. It is unknown how individual U.S. institutions and practitioners assign profiles and if modifiers improve on risk discrimination. METHODS: Respondents (n = 212) to a web-based survey answered questions about the INTERMACS profile assignment process in their institution. For 5 hypothetical clinical scenarios, respondents assigned the best profile. The INTERMACS registry (2009-2014) was queried, and hazard ratio (HR) (95\% confidence interval [CI]) for mortality between profiles as well as based on the presence of temporary circulatory support (TCS), frequent flyer (FF), or arrhythmia modifiers was calculated. RESULTS: Respondents included 131 (62\%) cardiologists, 30 (14\%) surgeons, and 51 (24\%) physician extenders/coordinators. Institutional INTERMACS profile assignment was variable (63\% assigned by cardiologists/surgeons; 10\% by research coordinators; 27\% by physician extenders). Profile assignments in hypothetical patient scenarios were heterogeneous, especially for contiguous profiles. The 1-year survivals for Profiles 1, 2, and 3 were 77 {$\pm$} 1.2\%, 80 {$\pm$} 0.7\%, and 84 {$\pm$} 0.7\% (p {$<$} 0.001). Although Profile 1 patients had worse adjusted survival than Profile 3 patients (p = 0.001), survival for Profile 1 patients vs Profile 2 patients was similar (adjusted HR = 1.01 [95\% CI = 0.88-1.12]). The TCS (adjusted HR = 1.1 [95\% CI = 0.94-1.2]) and arrhythmia (adjusted HR = 1.1 [95\% CI = 0.97-1.2]) modifiers were not predictive of mortality, but the FF modifier was (HR = 1.3 [95\% CI = 1.02-1.63]). CONCLUSIONS: Substantial heterogeneity exists in the process and assignment of INTERMACS profiles. This heterogeneity could affect mortality estimates used for risk stratification. Only the FF modifier appears to improve risk discrimination beyond that of known risk factors. Adding objective descriptors may reduce profile heterogeneity.},

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Variations in complication rates or resource use among patients treated for a particular primary condition should be adjusted for coexistent disease. Age and ASA-PS scores are readily available and can be useful to stratify surgical patients for risk. METHODS: One thousand ninety patients at five academic medical centers in California and Massachusetts who underwent THR, TURP, or cholecystectomy between 1985 and 1987 were studied. Data were obtained from medical records and a self-administered questionnaire to measure length of stay (LOS), postoperative complication rates, and follow-up physician visits. Data were analyzed with one- and two-way analysis of variance with the Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: Increasing age and ASA-PS scores were associated significantly with increased LOS, complication rates, and frequency of post-discharge physician office visits. No interaction effect between age and ASA-PS scores was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Age and ASA-PS scores can predict postoperative morbidity, specific for each operation studied. Assessment of co-morbidity in surgical patients can be accomplished easily and with minimal expense. While remaining budget neutral, the distribution of reimbursements should be based on those preoperative risk factors that predict longer LOS and higher complication rates.},

Of 3195 patients deemed fit for surgery, 114 patients (3.5\%) had their surgery cancelled. Ninety-two cancellations (80\%) were due to the patient being deemed medically unsuitable for surgery by the anaesthetist. Cardiac disease was the most common reason for cancellation (n= 27), followed by pulmonary disease (n= 22). 77 patients (67.5\%) had their operation rescheduled and successfully performed in our institution at a later date.Conclusion. DOSA is associated with a low rate of cancellations on the day of surgery. Patients with cardiorespiratory comorbidities are at greatest risk of cancellation.},

When a test is based on an observed variable that lies on a continuous or graded scale, an assessment of the overall value of the test can be made through the use of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The curve is constructed by varying the cutpoint used to determine which values of the observed variable will be considered abnormal and then plotting the resulting sensitivities against the corresponding false positive rates. When two or more empirical curves are constructed based on tests performed on the same individuals, statistical analysis on differences between curves must take into account the correlated nature of the data. This paper presents a nonparametric approach to the analysis of areas under correlated ROC curves, by using the theory on generalized U-statistics to generate an estimated covariance matrix.},

This is part of the systemic reaction to injury which encompasses a wide range of endocrinological, immunological and haematological effects (Table 1).

In 1932, Cuthbertson described in detail the metabolic responses of four patients with lower limb injuries.10 He documented and quantified the time course of the changes. The terms `ebb' and `flow' were introduced to describe an initial decrease and subsequent increase in metabolic activity.

Discrete-event computer simulation over many years was used to represent surgical suites with an unchanging cancellation rate. Because the true cancellation rate was fixed, the accuracy of the statistical methods could be determined. Cancellations caused by medical events, rare events, cases lasting longer than scheduled, and full postanesthesia or intensive care unit beds were modeled. We found that applying Student's two-sample t-test to the transformation of the numbers of cases and canceled cases from each of six 4-wk periods was valid for most conditions. We recommend that clinicians and managers use this method in their quality monitoring reports. The other methods gave inaccurate results. For example, using chi(2) or Fisher's exact test, hospitals may erroneously determine that cancellation rates have increased when they really are unchanged. Conversely, if inappropriate statistical methods are used, administrators may claim success at reducing cancellation rates when, in fact, the problem remains unresolved, affecting patients and clinicians. IMPLICATIONS: Operating room cancellation rates can be monitored statistically by considering the number of canceled and performed cases during each 4-week period, performing a transformation of each period's cancellation rate, and then applying Student's t-test. Methods such as the Fisher's exact test and \{chi\}2 test should be avoided for this application because they can give erroneous results.},

Frequency and reasons of cancellation of elective surgical cases in different specialty were studied with a view to recommend suggestions for improvement. Data was analyzed on SPSS -16. RESULTS: There are 120 operating rooms (OR) in 25 Makkah region hospitals and during the year 2013, a total of 16,211 surgery cases were listed, and 1,238 (7.6\%) cases were canceled. Contribution to total cancellation was highest in orthopedic 33.8\% followed by general surgery 27.5\%, obstetrics 7.7\% and ENT 5.2\%. According to category, 42.81\% rate of cancellation was patient related, 20.03\% facility related, 9.45\% due to improper work-up, 1.45\% associated with anesthesia, 7.19\% related to surgeons, and 18.90\% other/and not recorded reasons. CONCLUSIONS: Present study found 7.6\% cancelation rate in Makkah region hospitals and three most common causes for cancellations were patients related, facility related and improper work-up.},

The aim of this review was to determine how accurately a surgeon's `gut feeling' or perception of risk correlates with patient outcomes and available risk scoring systems. Methods A systematic review was undertaken in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. A narrative synthesis was performed in accordance with the Guidance on the Conduct of Narrative Synthesis In Systematic Reviews. Studies comparing surgeons' preoperative or postoperative assessment of patient outcomes were included. Studies that made comparisons with risk scoring tools were also included. Outcomes evaluated were postoperative mortality, general and operation-specific morbidity and long-term outcomes. Results Twenty-seven studies comprising 20 898 patients undergoing general, gastrointestinal, cardiothoracic, orthopaedic, vascular, urology, endocrine and neurosurgical operations were included. Surgeons consistently overpredicted mortality rates and were outperformed by existing risk scoring tools in six of seven studies comparing area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC). Surgeons' prediction of general morbidity was good, and was equivalent to, or better than, pre-existing risk prediction models. Long-term outcomes were poorly predicted by surgeons, with AUC values ranging from 0{$\cdot$}51 to 0{$\cdot$}75. Four of five studies found postoperative risk estimates to be more accurate than those made before surgery. Conclusion Surgeons consistently overestimate mortality risk and are outperformed by pre-existing tools; prediction of longer-term outcomes is also poor. Surgeons should consider the use of risk prediction tools when available to inform clinical decision-making.},

They represent a significant loss of revenue and waste of resources, have significant psychological, social and financial implications for patients and their families and represent a significant loss of training opportunities for surgical trainees. The current study investigates the reasons for day of surgery cancellations at an NHS Foundation Trust in the United Kingdom and proposes strategies to reduce their incidence. All cancellations of elective and emergency procedures during the period from January 2012 to December 2012 were identified retrospectively using the IQ Utopia\texttrademark{} patient management software. The rate of cancellations on the day of surgery for elective and planned emergency procedures during 2012 was 5.19\%. The main reason for cancellation was patient not fit for operation (33.73\%), followed by lack of beds (21.79\%), lack of theatre time (17.31\%), patient failed to attend (6.87\%) and operation no longer necessary (4.08\%). Similar reasons for cancellations have been reported in studies from around the world. The~published literature provides various examples of successful and unsuccessful strategies to reduce surgery cancellations, even when they are caused by factors that are sometimes considered unavoidable. The feasibility and profitability of approaches that have been proven to be successful in other institutions should be assessed thoroughly in the context of the individual institution's characteristics and individual problems before a decision for implementation is made.},

Although the POSSUM (Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enumeration of Mortality and Morbidity) score can be used to calculate operative risk, its complexity makes its use unfeasible in the immediate clinical setting. The aim of this study was to create a new model, based on ASA status, to predict mortality. Methods. Data were collected in two hospitals. All types of surgery were included except for cardiac surgery and Caesarean delivery. Age, sex and preoperative information, including the presence of cardiocirculatory and/or lung disease, renal failure, diabetes mellitus, hepatic disease, cancer, Glasgow Coma Score, ASA grade, surgical diagnosis, severity of the procedure and type of surgery (elective, urgent or emergency), were recorded for each patient. The model was developed using a data set incorporating data from 1936 surgical patients, and validated using data from a further 1849 patients. Forward stepwise logistic regression was used to build the model. Goodness of fit was examined using the Hosmer\textendash Lemeshow test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed on both data sets to test calibration and discrimination. In the validation data set, the new model was compared with POSSUM and P-POSSUM for both calibration and discrimination, and with ASA alone to compare discrimination. Results. The following variables were included in the new model: ASA status, age, type of surgery (elective, urgent, emergency) and degree of surgery (minor, moderate or major). Calibration and discrimination of the new model were good in both development and validation data sets. This new model was better calibrated in the validation data set (Hosmer\textendash Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test: {$\chi$}2=6.8017, P=0.7440) than either P-POSSUM ({$\chi$}2=14.4643, P=0.1528) or POSSUM, which was not calibrated ({$\chi$}2=31.8147, P=0.0004). POSSUM and P-POSSUM had better discrimination than the new model, although this was not statistically significant. Comparing the two ROC curves, the new model had better discrimination than ASA alone (difference between areas, 0.077, se 0.034, 95\% confidence interval 0.012\textendash 0.143, P=0.021). Conclusions. This new, ASA status-based model is simple to use and can be performed routinely in the operating room to predict operative risk for both elective and emergency surgery.},

Patients~Adult patients after elective and non-elective surgery.         Intervention~Implementation of a clinical pathway with a nurse-driven fast-track programme for uncomplicated patients (systematic use of Aldrete score and systematic discharge without physician) and a physician-driven slow-track programme for complicated patients (systematic handover between operating theatre and post-anaesthesia care unit, and between post-anaesthesia care unit and ward, systematic rounds, systematic use of standardised care for post-operative events, strict discharge criteria).         Main outcome measures~Post-anaesthesia care unit length of stay, in-hospital mortality and unplanned admission to the ICU after post-anaesthesia care unit stay.         Methods~Comparison of the periods before and after implementation using median and interquartile range (IQR) and rates (\%). Statistical analysis: unpaired Student's t-test, {$\chi$} 2 test, Wilcoxon rank test.

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}Much biomedical research is observational. The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalisability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September, 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles. 18 items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies. A detailed explanation and elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the websites of \emph{PLoS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine}, and \emph{Epidemiology}. We hope that the STROBE statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The American Society of Anesthesiologists has embraced the concept of the Perioperative Surgical Home as a means through which anesthesiologists can add value to the health systems in which they practice. One key listed element of the Perioperative Surgical Home is to support "scheduling initiatives to reduce cancellations and increase efficiency." In this study, we explored the potential benefits of the Perioperative Surgical Home with respect to inpatient cancellations and add-on case scheduling. We evaluated 6 hypotheses related to the timing of inpatient cancellations and preoperative anesthesia evaluations. METHODS: Inpatient cancellations were studied during 26 consecutive 4-week intervals between July 2012 and June 2014 at a tertiary care academic hospital. All timestamps related to scheduling, rescheduling, and cancellation activities were retrieved from the operating room (OR) case scheduling system. Timestamps when patients were seen by anesthesia residents were obtained from the preoperative evaluation system database. Batch mean methods were used to calculate means and SE. For cases cancelled, we determined whether, for "most" ({$>$}50\%) cancellations, a subsequent procedure (of any type) was performed on the patient within 7 days of the cancellation. Comparisons with most and other fractions were assessed using the 1 group, 1-sided Student t test. We evaluated whether a few procedures were highly represented among the cancelled cases via the Herfindahl (Simpson's) index, comparing it with {$<$}0.15. The rate of scheduling activity was assessed by computing the number of OR scheduling office decisions in each 1-hour bin between 6:00 AM and 3:59 PM. These values were compared with {$\geq$}1 decision per hour at the study hospital. RESULTS: Data from 24,735 scheduled inpatient cases were assessed. Cases cancelled after 7 AM on the day before or at any time on the scheduled day of surgery accounted for 22.6\% {$\pm$} 0.5\% (SE) of the scheduled minutes all scheduled cases, and 26.8\% {$\pm$} 0.4\% of the case volume (i.e., number of cases). Most (83.1\% {$\pm$} 0.6\%, P {$<$} 10) cases performed were evaluated on the day before surgery. Most (67.6\% {$\pm$} 1.6\%, P {$<$} 10) minutes of cancelled cases were evaluated on the day before surgery. Most (62.3\% {$\pm$} 1.5\%, P {$<$} 10) cases were seen earlier than 6:00 PM of the day before surgery. The Herfindahl index among cancelled procedures was 0.021 {$\pm$} 0.001 (P {$<$} 10 compared not only to {$<$}0.15 but also to {$<$}0.05), showing large heterogeneity among the cancelled procedures. A subsequent procedure was not performed for most cancelled cases (50.6\% {$\pm$} 0.9\% compared with {$>$}50\%, P = 0.12), implying that the indication for the cancelled procedure no longer existed or the patient/family decided not to proceed with surgery. When only cancellations on the scheduled day of surgery were considered, the cancellation rate was 14.0\% {$\pm$} 0.3\% of scheduled inpatient minutes and 11.8\% {$\pm$} 0.2\% of scheduled inpatient cases. There were 0.59 {$\pm$} 0.02 OR schedule decisions per hour per 10 ORs between 6:00 AM and 3:59 PM (P {$<$} 10, corresponding to {$\geq$}1 decision per hour at the 36 OR study hospital). CONCLUSIONS: The study hospital had a high inpatient cancellation rate, despite the fact that most patients whose cases were cancelled were seen by an anesthesia resident by 6:00 PM of the day before surgery. This finding suggests that further efforts to reduce the cancellations by seeing patients sooner on the day before surgery, or seeing even more patients the day before surgery, would not be an economically useful focus of the Perioperative Surgical Home. The wide heterogeneity among cancelled cases indicates that focusing on a few procedures would not materially affect the overall cancellation rate. The relatively low rate of subsequent performance of a procedure on patients whose cases had been cancelled suggests that trying to decrease the cancellation rate might be medically counterproductive. The hourly rate of decisions in the scheduling office during regular work hours on the day of surgery highlights the importance of decisions made at the OR control desk and scheduling office throughout the day to reduce the hours of overused OR time. These data suggest that efforts of the Perioperative Surgical Home related to inpatient cancellations should focus on management decision-making to mitigate the disruptions to the planned OR schedule caused by inpatient case cancellations and add-on cases, more so than on efforts to reduce inpatient cancellation rates.},

This study was designed to determine the causes of cancellation, preventability, total operating room time, and postoperative destination. DESIGN: This study was a retrospective review of the 43 cardiac surgical cases that were cancelled while the patient was in the operating room (OR) but prior to surgical incision. SETTING: The cases were performed at the Massachusetts General Hospital, a teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-three out of 5,110 scheduled cardiac cases were identified that were cancelled after the patient had entered the operating room between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2013. INTERVENTIONS: No interventions were made. This was a retrospective study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The most common causes of cancellation included a change in the patient's health status (44\%), problems associated with central catheter placement (18.6\%), and unsatisfactory donor organs for planned transplantation (12\%). The majority were inpatients (65\%) prior to the procedure. The cumulative OR time for all cancelled cases was 5,374 minutes (89 hours and 34 minutes). CONCLUSIONS: The reason for cancellation, preventability, total operating room time, and postoperative destination were determined. The information can be utilized to decrease the number of future cancellations.},

DESIGN: Multicenter, two-arm, parallel-group, open-label randomized controlled trial. SETTING: 11 university hospital ambulatory surgery units in Paris, France. PARTICIPANTS: Patients scheduled for ambulatory surgery and able to be reached by telephone. INTERVENTION: A 7-item checklist designed to prevent late cancellation, available in five languages and two versions (for children and adults), was administered between 7 and 3 days before the planned date of surgery, by an automated phone system or a research assistant. The control group received standard management alone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of cancellation on the day of surgery or the day before. RESULTS: The study population comprised 3900 patients enrolled between November 2012 and September 2013: 1950 patients were randomized to the checklist arm and 1950 patients to the control arm. The checklist was administered to 68.8\% of patients in the intervention arm, 1002 by the automated phone system and 340 by a research assistant. The rate of late cancellation did not differ significantly between the checklist and control arms (109 (5.6\%) vs. 113 (5.8\%), adjusted odds ratio [95\% confidence interval] = 0.91 [0.65-1.29], (p = 0.57)). Checklist administration revealed that 355 patients (28.0\%) had not undergone tests ordered by the surgeon or anesthetist, and that 254 patients (20.0\%) still had questions concerning the fasting state. CONCLUSIONS: A standardized pre-operative telephone checklist did not avoid late cancellations of ambulatory surgery but enabled us to identify several frequent causes.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Today, the rate of surgeries is increasing, but surgeries are canceled due to various reasons. Unexpected cancellation of surgeries not only results in disorder in the operating room schedule, but also causes stress for patients and their family and increases costs. We determined the number and causes of surgery cancellations and areas for improvement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This outcome evaluation of Six Sigma program was conducted on 850 cases after the implementation of the program and compared to that of 850 cases which received routine care before the program. Cases were selected through easy sampling during the study. Before the implementation, the number of cancellations was recorded daily and their reasons were investigated. Then, Six Sigma program was implemented in accordance with the reasons for each category and necessary steps were taken to prevent the cancellation of surgeries. Data were collected for 3 months using a three-section data collection form. For data analysis, distribution and relative frequency and chi-square test were used. RESULTS: The three categories of patient, physician, and hospital system were identified as the main causes. The highest rate of cancellation was related to ENT surgeries (74.19\%). No cancellations were made in orology surgeries. The implementation of the Six Sigma program caused a significant difference in surgery cancellation (P = 0.003); 31 (3.6\%) cases of cancellation were reduced to 12 (1.4\%) cases. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that Six Sigma program is a pre-surgery care quality improvement program. Patient education and the implementation of the 6 sigma program can be effective in reducing the rate of cancellation of operations.},

High-risk patients frequently require critical care either in the immediate postoperative period or after developing complications. The purpose of this review was to identify and prioritise themes for future research in perioperative intensive care medicine.MethodsWe undertook a priority setting process (PSP). A panel was convened, drawn from experts representing a wide geographical area, plus a patient representative. The panel was asked to suggest and prioritise key uncertainties and future research questions in the field of perioperative intensive care through a modified Delphi process. Clinical trial registries were searched for on-going research. A proposed ``Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome'' (PICO) structure for each question was provided.ResultsTen key uncertainties and future areas of research were identified as priorities and ranked. Appropriate intravenous fluid and blood component therapy, use of critical care resources, prevention of delirium and respiratory management featured prominently.ConclusionAdmissions following surgery contribute a substantial proportion of critical care workload. Studies aimed at improving care in this group could have a large impact on patient-centred outcomes and optimum use of healthcare resources. In particular, the optimum use of critical care resources in this group is an area that requires urgent research.},

We sought to determine the effect of ICU admission on perioperative (30\,day) and long-term mortality.Methods. This was an observational study of all surgical patients in Scotland during 2005\textendash 7 followed up until 2012. Patient, operative, and care process factors were extracted. The primary outcome was perioperative mortality; secondary outcomes were 1 and 4\,yr mortality. Multivariable regression was used to construct a risk prediction model to allow standard-risk and high-risk groups to be defined based on deciles of predicted perioperative mortality risk, and to determine the effect of ICU admission (direct from theatre; indirect after initial care on ward; no ICU admission) on outcome adjusted for confounders.Results. There were 572~598 patients included. The risk model performed well (c-index 0.92). Perioperative mortality occurred in 1125 (0.2\%) in the standard-risk group (n=510~979) and in 3636 (6.4\%) in the high-risk group (n=56~785). Patients with no ICU admission within 7~days of surgery had the lowest perioperative mortality (whole cohort 0.7\%; high-risk cohort 5.3\%). Indirect ICU admission was associated with a higher risk of perioperative mortality when compared with direct admission for the whole cohort (20.9 vs 12.1\%; adjusted odds ratio 2.39, 95\% confidence interval 2.01\textendash 2.84; P\&lt;0.01) and for high-risk patients (26.2 vs 17.8\%; adjusted odds ratio 1.64, 95\% confidence interval 1.37\textendash 1.96; P\&lt;0.01). Compared with direct ICU admission, indirectly admitted patients had higher severity of illness on admission, required more organ support, and had an increased duration of ICU stay.Conclusions. Indirect ICU admission was associated with increased mortality and increased requirement for organ support.Trial registration. UKCRN registry no. 15761.},

  abstract = {Objective:~To develop a 30-day mortality risk index for noncardiac surgery that can be used to communicate risk information to patients and guide clinical management at the ``point-of-care,'' and that can be used by surgeons and hospitals to internally audit their quality of care.         Background:~Clinicians rely on the Revised Cardiac Risk Index to quantify the risk of cardiac complications in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Because mortality from noncardiac causes accounts for many perioperative deaths, there is also a need for a simple bedside risk index to predict 30-day all-cause mortality after noncardiac surgery.         Methods:~Retrospective cohort study of 298,772 patients undergoing noncardiac surgery during 2005 to 2007 using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database.         Results:~The 9-point S-MPM (Surgical Mortality Probability Model) 30-day mortality risk index was derived empirically and includes three risk factors: ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) physical status, emergency status, and surgery risk class. Patients with ASA physical status I, II, III, IV or V were assigned either 0, 2, 4, 5, or 6 points, respectively; intermediate- or high-risk procedures were assigned 1 or 2 points, respectively; and emergency procedures were assigned 1 point. Patients with risk scores less than 5 had a predicted risk of mortality less than 0.50\%, whereas patients with a risk score of 5 to 6 had a risk of mortality between 1.5\% and 4.0\%. Patients with a risk score greater than 6 had risk of mortality more than 10\%. S-MPM exhibited excellent discrimination (C statistic, 0.897) and acceptable calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic 13.0, P = 0.023) in the validation data set.         Conclusions:~Thirty-day mortality after noncardiac surgery can be accurately predicted using a simple and accurate risk score based on information readily available at the bedside. This risk index may play a useful role in facilitating shared decision making, developing and implementing risk-reduction strategies, and guiding quality improvement efforts.},

We review and comment on the long-used guidelines for interpreting evidence as supporting a causal association and contrast them with the potential outcomes framework that encourages thinking in terms of causes that are interventions. We argue that in public health this framework is more suitable, providing an estimate of an action's consequences rather than the less precise notion of a risk factor's causal effect. A variety of modern statistical methods adopt this approach. When an intervention cannot be specified, causal relations can still exist, but how to intervene to change the outcome will be unclear. In application, the often-complex structure of causal processes needs to be acknowledged and appropriate data collected to study them. These newer approaches need to be brought to bear on the increasingly complex public health challenges of our globalized world.},

  abstract = {Background Currently, there is no standardised tool used to capture morbidity following abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. The aim of this prospective observational study was to validate the Postoperative Morbidity Survey (POMS) according to its two guiding principles: to only capture morbidity substantial enough to delay discharge from hospital and to be a rapid, simple screening tool. Methods A total of 64 adult patients undergoing elective infrarenal AAA repair participated in the study. Following surgery, the POMS was recorded daily, by trained research staff with the clinical teams blinded, until hospital discharge or death. We modelled the data using Cox regression, accounting for the competing risk of death, with POMS as a binary time-dependent (repeated measures) internal covariate. For each day for each patient, `discharged' (yes/no) was the event, with the elapsed number of days post-surgery as the time variable. We derived the hazard ratio for any POMS morbidity (score 1\textendash 9) vs. no morbidity (zero), adjusted for type of repair (endovascular versus open), age and aneurysm size. Results The hazard ratio for alive discharge with any POMS-recorded morbidity versus no morbidity was 0.130 (95~\% confidence interval 0.070 to 0.243). The median time-to-discharge was 13~days after recording any POMS morbidity vs. 2~days after scoring zero for POMS morbidity. Compliance with POMS completion was 99.5~\%. Conclusions The POMS is a valid tool for capturing short-term postoperative morbidity following elective infrarenal AAA repair that is substantial enough to delay discharge from hospital. Daily POMS measurement is recommended to fully capture morbidity and allow robust analysis. The survey could be a valuable outcome measure for use in quality improvement programmes and future research.},

  abstract = {Objectives To describe the reliability and validity of the Postoperative Morbidity Survey (POMS). To describe the level and pattern of short-term postoperative morbidity after major elective surgery using the POMS. Study Design and Setting This was a prospective cohort study of 439 adults undergoing major elective surgery in a UK teaching hospital. The POMS, an 18-item survey that address nine domains of postoperative morbidity, was recorded on postoperative days 3, 5, 8, and 15. Results Inter-rater reliability was perfect for 11/18 items (Kappa = 1.0), with Kappa = 0.94 for 6/18 items. A priori hypotheses that the POMS would discriminate between patients with known measures of morbidity risk, and predict length of stay were generally supported through observation of data trends, and there was statistically significant evidence of construct validity for all but the wound and neurological domains. POMS-defined morbidity was present in 325 of 433 patients (75.1\%) remaining in hospital on postoperative day 3 after surgery, 231 of 407 patients (56.8\%) on day 5, 138 of 299 patients (46.2\%) on day 8, and 70 of 111 patients (63.1\%) on day 15. Gastrointestinal (47.4\%), infectious (46.5\%), pain-related (40.3\%), pulmonary (39.4\%), and renal problems (33.3\%) were the most common forms of morbidity. Conclusion The POMS is a reliable and valid survey of short-term postoperative morbidity in major elective surgery. Many patients remain in hospital without any morbidity as recorded by the POMS.},

  abstract = {Background Although a risk score estimating postoperative mortality for patients undergoing gastric bypass exists, there is none predicting postoperative morbidity. Our objective was to develop a validated risk calculator for 30-day postoperative morbidity of bariatric surgery patients. Study Design We used the American College of Surgeons' 2007 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) dataset. Patients undergoing bariatric surgery for morbid obesity were studied. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed and a risk calculator was created. The 2008 NSQIP dataset was used for its validation. Results In 11,023 patients, mean age was 44.6 years, 20\% were male, 77\% were Caucasian, and mean body mass index (BMI; calculated as kg/m2) was 48.9. Thirty-day morbidity and mortality were 4.2\% and 0.2\%, respectively. Risk factors associated with increased risk of postoperative morbidity included recent MI/angina (odds ratio [OR] = 3.65; 95\% CI 1.23 to 10.8), dependent functional status (OR = 3.48; 95\% CI 1.78 to -6.80), stroke (OR = 2.89; 95\% CI 1.09 to 7.67), bleeding disorder (OR = 2.23; 95\% CI 1.47 to 3.38), hypertension (OR = 1.34; 95\% CI 1.10 to 1.63), BMI, and type of bariatric surgery. Patients with BMI 35 to \&lt;45 and \&gt;60 had significantly higher adjusted OR compared with patients with BMI of 45 to 60 (p \&lt; 0.05 for all). These factors were used to create the risk calculator and subsequently validate it, with the model performance very similar between the 2007 training dataset and the 2008 validation dataset (c-statistics: 0.69 and 0.66, respectively). Conclusions NSQIP data can be used to develop and validate a risk calculator that predicts postoperative morbidity after various bariatric procedures. The risk calculator is anticipated to aid in surgical decision making, informed patient consent, and risk reduction.},

We propose applying data mining techniques to extract useful knowledge and draw an accurate model to predict the LOS of heart patients. Methods Data were collected from patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient records of 4,948 patients who had suffered CAD were included in the analysis. The techniques used are classification with three algorithms, namely, decision tree, support vector machines (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). LOS is the target variable, and 36 input variables are used for prediction. A confusion matrix was obtained to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Results The overall accuracy of SVM was 96.4\% in the training set. Most single patients (64.3\%) had an LOS {$\leq$}5 days, whereas 41.2\% of married patients had an LOS {$>$}10 days. Moreover, the study showed that comorbidity states, such as lung disorders and hemorrhage with drug consumption have an impact on long LOS. The presence of comorbidities, an ejection fraction {$<$}2, being a current smoker, and having social security type insurance in coronary artery patients led to longer LOS than other subjects. Conclusions All three algorithms are able to predict LOS with various degrees of accuracy. The findings demonstrated that the SVM was the best fit. There was a significant tendency for LOS to be longer in patients with lung or respiratory disorders and high blood pressure.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Complications from major surgery are undesirable, common, and potentially avoidable. The long-term consequences of short-term surgical complications have recently been recognized to have a profound influence on longevity and quality of life in survivors. In the past 30 years, there have been a number of studies conducted attempting to reduce surgical mortality and morbidity by deliberately and preemptively manipulating perioperative hemodynamics. Early studies had a high control-group mortality rate and were criticized for this as being unrepresentative of current practice and raised opposition to its implementation as routine care. We performed this review to update this body of literature and to examine the effect of changes in current practice and quality of care to see whether the conclusions from previous quantitative analyses of this field remain valid. METHODS: Randomized clinical trials evaluating the use of preemptive hemodynamic intervention to improve surgical outcome were identified using multiple methods. Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials register) were screened for potential trials, reference lists of identified trials were examined, and additional sources were sought from experts and industry representatives. Identified studies that fulfilled the entry criteria were examined in full and subjected to quantifiable analysis, subgroup analysis, and sensitivity analysis where possible. RESULTS: There were 29 studies identified, 23 of which reported surgical complications. In total, the 29 trials involved 4805 patients with an overall mortality of 7.6\%. The use of preemptive hemodynamic intervention significantly reduced mortality (pooled odds ratio [95\% confidence interval] of 0.48 [0.33-0.78]; P = 0.0002) and surgical complications (odds ratio 0.43 [0.34-0.53]; P {$<$} 0.0001). Subgroup analysis showed significant reductions in mortality for studies using a pulmonary artery catheter, supranormal resuscitation targets, studies using cardiac index or oxygen delivery as goals, and the use of fluids and inotropes as opposed to fluids alone. By contrast, there was a significant reduction in morbidity for each of the 4 subgroups analyzed. CONCLUSION: The use of a preemptive strategy of hemodynamic monitoring and coupled therapy reduces surgical mortality and morbidity.},

  abstract = {PurposeTo estimate the effect of prompt admission to critical care on mortality for deteriorating ward patients.MethodsWe performed a prospective cohort study of consecutive ward patients assessed for critical care. Prompt admissions (within 4 h of assessment) were compared to a `watchful waiting' cohort. We used critical care strain (bed occupancy) as a natural randomisation event that would predict prompt transfer to critical care. Strain was classified as low, medium or high (2+, 1 or 0 empty beds). This instrumental variable (IV) analysis was repeated for the subgroup of referrals with a recommendation for critical care once assessed. Risk-adjusted 90-day survival models were also constructed.ResultsA total of 12,380 patients from 48 hospitals were available for analysis. There were 2411 (19\%) prompt admissions (median delay 1 h, IQR 1\textendash 2) and 9969 (81\%) controls; 1990 (20\%) controls were admitted later (median delay 11 h, IQR 6\textendash 26). Prompt admissions were less frequent (p {$<$} 0.0001) as strain increased from low (22\%), to medium (15\%) to high (9\%); the median delay to admission was 3, 4 and 5 h respectively. In the IV analysis, prompt admission reduced 90-day mortality by 7.4\% (95\% CI 1.7\textendash 18.5\%, p = 0.117) overall, and 16.2\% (95\% CI 1.1\textendash 31.3\%, p = 0.036) for those recommended for critical care. In the risk-adjust survival model, 90-day mortality was similar.ConclusionAfter allowing for unobserved prognostic differences between the groups, we find that prompt admission to critical care leads to lower 90-day mortality for patients assessed and recommended to critical care.},

Largely forgotten today, lithotomy relieved the anguish of bladder stones and identified urology as a medical specialty nearly 2500 years ago. METHODS The historical literature pertaining to lithotomy was reviewed. Translated and original documents describing operative techniques and developments pertaining to the history of lithotomy were obtained through the internet and library sources. RESULTS The ancient art of lithotomy was first recorded by the Greeks and evolved through five phases: the Celsian method, or `lesser operation'; the Marian, or `greater operation'; the lateral operation; suprapubic cystotomy, or `high operation', and proctocystotomy. The practice of open lithotomy ceased to exist owing to better minimally invasive alternative methods and most notably by the virtual disappearance of bladder stones in modern man. CONCLUSIONS The history of lithotomy is a fascinating story of how early surgeons forced by the culture and customs of the time dealt with common but devastating bladder stones. Out of their efforts, urology was born.},

Ten of 18 cases (55.6\%) that were cancelled before general anesthesia induction could have been prevented, accounting for 36.7\% of the overall cancellations. The majority of the cancellations after anesthesia were due to the patients' health status.

  abstract = {Recent work has shown that there may be disadvantages in the use of the chi-square-like goodness-of-fit tests for the logistic regression model proposed by Hosmer and Lemeshow that use fixed groups of the estimated probabilities. A particular concern with these grouping strategies based on estimated probabilities, fitted values, is that groups may contain subjects with widely different values of the covariates. It is possible to demonstrate situations where one set of fixed groups shows the model fits while the test rejects fit using a different set of fixed groups. We compare the performance by simulation of these tests to tests based on smoothed residuals proposed by le Cessie and Van Houwelingen and Royston, a score test for an extended logistic regression model proposed by Stukel, the Pearson chi-square and the unweighted residual sum-of-squares. These simulations demonstrate that all but one of Royston's tests have the correct size. An examination of the performance of the tests when the correct model has a quadratic term but a model containing only the linear term has been fit shows that the Pearson chi-square, the unweighted sum-of-squares, the Hosmer-Lemeshow decile of risk, the smoothed residual sum-of-squares and Stukel's score test, have power exceeding 50 per cent to detect moderate departures from linearity when the sample size is 100 and have power over 90 per cent for these same alternatives for samples of size 500. All tests had no power when the correct model had an interaction between a dichotomous and continuous covariate but only the continuous covariate model was fit. Power to detect an incorrectly specified link was poor for samples of size 100. For samples of size 500 Stukel's score test had the best power but it only exceeded 50 per cent to detect an asymmetric link function. The power of the unweighted sum-of-squares test to detect an incorrectly specified link function was slightly less than Stukel's score test. We illustrate the tests within the context of a model for factors associated with low birth weight.},

DESIGN: Questionnaires were distributed to 74 patients who had their operations cancelled. Their mood after discharge was measured with The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale. Ninety-three patients, who were operated on without postponement, served as controls. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of the patients in the cancellation group reacted negatively, especially if the reason for cancellation was organizational (P = 0.03). The women in the cancellation group had a significantly higher degree of depression than men (P = 0.01) and both women (P = 0.02) and men (P = 0.003) in the control group. Most of the patients, however, were satisfied with the nursing staff's reception and information. CONCLUSIONS: The patients reacted negatively to the cancellation, especially if it had organizational reasons. Women subjected to cancellation had a significantly higher degree of depression than other patients. To be avoided, organizational and medical problems must be identified in time. One way to do this is to introduce a preadmission nurse clinic.},

Randomized controlled trials investigating post-ICU consultations in adults with outcomes such as quality of life (QOL), anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), physical ability, cognitive function, and return to work were included. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed quality independently. The mean differences, risk ratios, and 95 \% confidence intervals were calculated depending on outcome measures.ResultsFrom 1544 citations, five trials were included (855 patients). The overall risk of bias was low in two trials, unclear in two trials, and high in one trial. The overall quality of evidence was low. The trials assessed follow-up interventions defined as consultations informing survivors about their ICU stay. One trial found no effect on QOL. Pooling data from two trials (n = 374) showed a protective effect on risk of new onset PTSD at 3\textendash 6 months after ICU (risk ratio 0.49, 95 \% CI 0.26\textendash 0.95). There was no effect on other outcomes.ConclusionsThe evidence indicates that follow-up consultations might reduce symptoms of PTSD at 3\textendash 6 months after ICU discharge in ICU survivors, but without affecting QOL and other outcomes investigated. This review highlights that planning of future RCTs should aim to standardize interventions and outcome measures to allow for comparisons across studies.},

However, patterns of ICU utilization are poorly understood. Our aims were to assess the incidence and determinants of ICU utilization after elective noncardiac surgical procedures.MethodsPopulation-based cohort study included adult patients who underwent 13 types of major elective noncardiac surgical procedures between 2006 and 2014 in Ontario, Canada. Primary outcome was early admission to ICU within 24 h after surgery. A prespecified analysis using multilevel logistic regression modeling separately examined patient- and hospital-level factors associated with early ICU admission within distinct groups of surgical procedures.ResultsEarly ICU admission occurred in 9.6\% of the included 541,524 patients. Patients admitted early to ICU showed higher median age (68 vs. 65 years), burden of prehospital comorbidities (Charlson comorbidity index score {$\geq$} 2, 33.1 vs. 10.4\%), 30-day mortality rates (2.4 vs. 0.3\%), and longer median postoperative hospital stays (6 vs. 4 days) than patients admitted to a ward. There was wide variation in proportions of patients admitted early to ICU across different surgery types (0.9\% for hysterectomy to 90.8\% for open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair) with generally low 30-day mortality across procedures (0.1\textendash 2.8\%). Within individual procedures, there was wide interhospital variation in the range of early ICU admission rates (hysterectomy 0.07\textendash 14.4\%, lower gastrointestinal resection 1.3\textendash 95\%, endovascular aortic aneurysm 1.3\textendash 95.2\%). The individual hospital where surgery was performed accounted for a large proportion of the variation in early ICU admission rates, with the median odds ratio ranging from 2.3 for hysterectomy to 21.5 for endovascular aortic aneurysm.ConclusionsThere is a wide variation in early ICU admission across and within surgical procedures. The individual hospital accounts for a large proportion of this variation. Further research is required to identify the basis for this variation and to develop better methods for allocating ICU resources for postoperative management of surgical patients.},

Outcomes are sub-optimal for such patients, perhaps in part related to inadequate provision or ineffective utilisation of critical care resources. In this study, data describing 26 051 in-patient non-cardiac surgical procedures performed in a large NHS Trust between April 2002 and March 2005 were extracted from local databases. Of these procedures, 2 414 (9.3\%) were high risk with an overall mortality rate of 12.2\% and a prolonged hospital stay (high-risk population median (IQR) 16 (9\textendash 30) days vs standard risk 3 (2\textendash 6) days). Mortality rates for specific procedures were consistent with UK averages. However, only 852 (35.3\%) high-risk patients were admitted to a critical care unit at any stage after surgery. Of 294 high-risk patients who died, only 144 (49.0\%) were admitted to a critical care unit at any time and only 75 (25.6\%) of these deaths occurred within a critical care area. Mortality rates were high amongst patients discharged and readmitted to critical care (37.7\%) and amongst those admitted to critical care following initial postoperative care on a standard ward (29.9\%). These data suggest that the outcome of high-risk general surgical patients could be improved by adequate provision and more effective utilisation of critical care resources.},

Participants 8373 consecutive unselected total hip arthroplasty (THA) and knee arthroplasty from January 2010 to November 2012. Results There were 557 procedures (6.4\%) followed by potentially preventable complications resulting in hospitalisation {$>$}4 days or readmission. Of 22 preoperative characteristics, 7 were associated with 379 (4.2\%) potentially preventable `medical' complications. Patients with {$\geq$}2 of the following, age {$\geq$}80 years, anticoagulant therapy, pulmonary disease, pharmacologically treated psychiatric disorder, anaemia and walking aids, composed 19.1\% of the procedures; 55.7\% constituted potentially preventable `medical' complications that were mainly falls, mobilisation issues, pneumonias and cardiac arrhythmias. The number needed to be treated for a hypothetical intervention leading to 25\% reduction in potentially preventable `medical' complications was 34. THA, use of walking aids and cardiac disease were associated with 189 (2.2\%) `surgical' complications, but no clinically relevant preoperative prediction was possible. Conclusions Preoperative identification of patients at high risk of preventable `medical', but not `surgical', complications is statistically possible. However, clinical relevance is limited.

Our aim was to describe the relationship between the provision and use of critical care resources and postoperative mortality.MethodsPlanned analysis of data collected during an international 7-day cohort study of adults undergoing elective in-patient surgery. We used risk-adjusted mixed-effects logistic regression models to evaluate the association between admission to critical care immediately after surgery and in-hospital mortality. We evaluated hospital-level associations between mortality and critical care admission immediately after surgery, critical care admission to treat life-threatening complications, and hospital provision of critical care beds. We evaluated the effect of national income using interaction tests.Results44,814 patients from 474 hospitals in 27 countries were available for analysis. Death was more frequent amongst patients admitted directly to critical care after surgery (critical care: 103/4317 patients [2\%], standard ward: 99/39,566 patients [0.3\%]; adjusted OR 3.01 [2.10\textendash 5.21]; p {$<$} 0.001). This association may differ with national income (high income countries OR 2.50 vs. low and middle income countries OR 4.68; p = 0.07). At hospital level, there was no association between mortality and critical care admission directly after surgery (p = 0.26), critical care admission to treat complications (p = 0.33), or provision of critical care beds (p = 0.70). Findings of the hospital-level analyses were not affected by national income status. A sensitivity analysis including only high-risk patients yielded similar findings.ConclusionsWe did not identify any survival benefit from critical care admission following surgery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traditionally, the operating room (OR) in an academic medical center has faced numerous challenges to effective clinical productivity, including additional missions of teaching and research. Level 1 trauma poses more challenges related to the need for additional specialized personnel in anesthesia, surgery, and nursing. The present investigation explores lessons learned in efficiency, teamwork, and data evaluation at a level 1 academic teaching facility. METHODS: The months of July 2012, July 2013, and July 2014 were selected for this study. Multiple strategies were implemented through the Operating Room Committee during this time in an effort to reduce the number of OR delays and cancellations. RESULTS: Case cancellations decreased significantly over the three-year period, while delays remained relatively stable. In July 2012, 15.0\% of cases were cancelled and 10.2\% were delayed. Cancellations decreased to 6.3\% in 2013 and to 5.9\% in 2014. The total number of cases completed per month increased each year throughout the study, from 577 in 2012 to 649 in 2013 to 842 in 2014. CONCLUSION: These results are remarkable in comparison to the greater-than 20\% cancellation rate recorded in 2005 when the current OR leadership team first assessed OR efficiency. An increase in the number of cases completed per month likely can be attributed to a reduction in the number of case cancellations. Increased efficiency allows for more operations to be performed, leading to increased profitability and an increased ability of hospitals to continue caring for patients. We advocate the implementation of a comprehensive multidisciplinary strategy for sustained improvement in OR efficiency and utilization.},

We exploit geographic variation in broadcast reception derived from technological limitations, including distance to a broadcast tower and UHF versus VHF transmission. We relate this variation to Census data on grade-for-age status, educational attainment, and labor market outcomes in 1980, 1990, and 2000, respectively. The results indicate that Sesame Street improved school readiness, particularly for boys and children living in economically disadvantaged areas. The estimated impact on ultimate educational attainment and labor market outcomes is inconclusive.},

  abstract = {Background The impact of developments in colorectal cancer surgery on length-of-stay (LOS) and re-admission have not been well described. In a population-based analysis, we investigated predictors of LOS and emergency readmission after the initial surgery episode. Methods Incident colorectal cancers (ICD-O2: C18-C20), diagnosed 2002-2008, were identified from the National Cancer Registry Ireland, and linked to hospital in-patient episodes. For those who underwent colorectal resection, the associated hospital episode was identified. Factors predicting longer LOS (upper-quartile, {$>$} 24 days) for elective and emergency admissions separately, and whether LOS predicted emergency readmission within 28 days of discharge, were investigated using logistic regression. Results 8197 patients underwent resection, 63\% (n = 5133) elective and 37\% (n = 3063) emergency admissions. Median LOS was 14 days (inter-quartile range (IQR) = 11-20) for elective and 21 (15-33) for emergency admissions. For both emergency and elective admissions, likelihood of longer LOS was significantly higher in patients who were older, had co-morbidities and were unmarried; it was reduced for private patients. For emergency patients only the likelihood of longer LOS was lower for patients admitted to higher-volume hospitals. Longer LOS was associated with increased risk of emergency readmission. Conclusions One quarter of patients stay in hospital for at least 25 days following colorectal resection. Over one third of resected patients are emergency admissions and these have a significantly longer median LOS. Patient- and health service-related factors were associated with prolonged LOS. Longer LOS was associated with increased risk of emergency readmission. The cost implications of these findings are significant.},

  abstract = {Net reclassification indices have recently become popular statistics for measuring the prediction increment of new biomarkers. We review the various types of net reclassification indices and their correct interpretations. We evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of quantifying the prediction increment with these indices. For predefined risk categories, we relate net reclassification indices to existing measures of the prediction increment. We also consider statistical methodology for constructing confidence intervals for net reclassification indices and evaluate the merits of hypothesis testing based on such indices. We recommend that investigators using net reclassification indices should report them separately for events (cases) and nonevents (controls). When there are two risk categories, the components of net reclassification indices are the same as the changes in the true- and false-positive rates. We advocate the use of true- and false-positive rates and suggest it is more useful for investigators to retain the existing, descriptive terms. When there are three or more risk categories, we recommend against net reclassification indices because they do not adequately account for clinically important differences in shifts among risk categories. The category-free net reclassification index is a new descriptive device designed to avoid predefined risk categories. However, it experiences many of the same problems as other measures such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. In addition, the category-free index can mislead investigators by overstating the incremental value of a biomarker, even in independent validation data. When investigators want to test a null hypothesis of no prediction increment, the well-established tests for coefficients in the regression model are superior to the net reclassification index. If investigators want to use net reclassification indices, confidence intervals should be calculated using bootstrap methods rather than published variance formulas. The preferred single-number summary of the prediction increment is the improvement in net benefit.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify the determinants of 30-day postoperative mortality and long-term survival after major surgery as exemplified by 8 common operations. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database contains pre-, intra-, and 30-day postoperative data, prospectively collected in a standardized fashion by a dedicated nurse reviewer, on major surgery in the Veterans Administration (VA). The Beneficiary Identification and Records Locator Subsystem (BIRLS) is a VA file that depicts the vital status of U.S. veterans with 87\% to 95\% accuracy. METHODS: NSQIP data were merged with BIRLS to determine the vital status of 105,951 patients who underwent 8 types of operations performed between 1991 and 1999, providing an average follow up of 8 years. Logistic and Cox regression analyses were performed to identify the predictors of 30-day mortality and long-term survival, respectively. RESULTS: The most important determinant of decreased postoperative survival was the occurrence, within 30 days postoperatively, of any one of 22 types of complications collected in the NSQIP. Independent of preoperative patient risk, the occurrence of a 30-day complication in the total patient group reduced median patient survival by 69\%. The adverse effect of a complication on patient survival was also influenced by the operation type and was sustained even when patients who did not survive for 30 days were excluded from the analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of a 30-day postoperative complication is more important than preoperative patient risk and intraoperative factors in determining the survival after major surgery in the VA. Quality and process improvement in surgery should be directed toward the prevention of postoperative complications.},

However, the degree to which extended LOS represents complications, patient illness, or inefficient practice style is unclear.Objective To examine the influence of complications on the variance in hospitals' extended LOS rates after colorectal resections.Design, Setting, and Participants In this retrospective cohort study performed from January 1 through December 31, 2009, we analyzed data from the 2009 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Study participants were 22 664 adults undergoing colorectal resections in 199 hospitals.Exposures Inpatient complications recorded in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program registry. Inpatient complications were identified by the association of the complication's postoperative date with the patient's surgical discharge date.Main Outcome and Measure Hospitals' risk-adjusted extended LOS rates, defined as the proportion of patients with a hospital stay greater than the 75th percentile for the entire cohort.Results A total of 2177 patients (42.8\%) with extended LOSs did not have a documented inpatient complication. Although there was wide variation in risk-adjusted extended LOS (14.5\%-35.3\%) and risk-adjusted inpatient complication (12.1\%-28.5\%) rates, there was only a weak correlation (Spearman {$\rho$} = 0.56, P {$<$} .001) between the two. Only 52.0\% of the variation in hospitals' extended LOS rates was attributable to hospitals' inpatient complication rates.Conclusions and Relevance Much of the variation in hospitals' risk-adjusted extended LOS rates is not attributable to patient illness or complications and therefore most likely represents differences in practice style. Efforts to reduce excess resource use should focus on efficiency of care, such as increased adoption of enhanced recovery pathways.},

This study was planned to evaluate reasons for cancellation of elective surgical operation on the day of surgery in a 500 bedded Government hospital. Materials and Methods: The medical records of all the patients, from December 2009 to November 2010, who had their operations cancelled on the day of surgery in all surgical units of the hospital, were audited prospectively. The number of operation cancelled and reasons for cancellation were documented. Results: 7272 patients were scheduled for elective surgical procedures during study period; 1286 (17.6 \%) of these were cancelled on the day of surgery. The highest number of cancellation occurred in the discipline of general surgery (7.1\%) and the least (0.35\%) occurred in Ear-Nose-Throat surgery. The most common cause of cancellation was the lack of availability of theater time 809 (63\%) and patients not turning up 244 (19\%) patients. 149 cancellations (11.6\%) were because of medical reasons; 16 (1.2\%) were cancelled by the surgeon due to a change in the surgical plan; 28 (2.1\%) were cancelled as patients were not ready for surgery; and 40 (3.1\%) were cancelled due to equipment failure.]. Conclusion: Most causes of cancellations of operations are preventable.},

This study aims to compare the accuracy of survival prediction by expert oncologists versus the revised Tokuhashi scores with actual survivals in a cohort of symptomatic spinal metastases patients. METHODS: All patients who underwent surgical treatment for metastatic spinal tumours in a tertiary hospital between January 2011 to December 2015 were reviewed. Each patient's data was reconstructed into an anonymised clinical scenario and presented independently to five blinded attending oncologists with at least three years' post fellowship experience. They were surveyed for survival prediction twice at no less than four weeks' interval apart; the test-retest reliability was examined. The agreement of their prognostication and modified Tokuhashi scores were compared with actual survivals. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were included during the study period. The mean age at presentation was 61.1 years (range, 41 to 79), and mean actual survival was 21.6 months (range, 1 to 68). Cohen's kappa agreement with actual survival was higher by oncologists' estimation (0.52) than by revised Tokuhashi score prediction (0.31) (p~=~0.018). Intra-class correlation showed high inter-reliability (0.71) between the five oncologists and a high test-retest reliability (0.69) between both rounds of the survey. CONCLUSION: This study showed that expert oncologists provided more accurate survival prediction than revised Tokuhashi scores in patients with spinal metastases. Future studies are required to identify factors in their assessment that led to improved accuracy.},

Study Design and Setting Review of all published observational studies that evaluated a clinical intervention using simultaneously PS and IV analyses, as identified in MEDLINE and Web of Science. Results Thirty-seven studies, most of them published during the previous 5~years, reported 55 comparisons between results from PS and IV analyses. There was a slight/fair agreement between the methods [Cohen's kappa coefficient~=~0.21 (95\% confidence interval: 0.00, 0.41)]. In 23 cases (42\%), results were nonsignificant for one method and significant for the other, and IV analysis results were nonsignificant in most situations (87\%). Conclusion Discrepancies are frequent between PS and IV analyses and can be interpreted in various ways. This suggests that researchers should carefully consider their analytical choices, and readers should be cautious when interpreting results, until further studies clarify the respective roles of the two methods in observational comparative effectiveness research.},

Inspired by the theory of linear normal models, the logistic regression model has been extended to allow for correlated responses by introducing random effects. However, the model does not inherit the interpretational features of the normal model. In this paper, the authors argue that the existing measures are unsatisfactory (and some of them are even improper) when quantifying results from multilevel logistic regression analyses. The authors suggest a measure of heterogeneity, the median odds ratio, that quantifies cluster heterogeneity and facilitates a direct comparison between covariate effects and the magnitude of heterogeneity in terms of well-known odds ratios. Quantifying cluster-level covariates in a meaningful way is a challenge in multilevel logistic regression. For this purpose, the authors propose an odds ratio measure, the interval odds ratio, that takes these difficulties into account.

Design Retrospective analysis. Setting University-affiliated hospital. Measurements Over a 5-year period, 45,663 surgeries requiring anesthesia occurred. Surgery was postponed or cancelled in the OR for 67 patients (0.15\%). Airway problems, change in medical condition, and change in surgical condition were the reasons recorded. Each patient's surgical result was audited using medical charts and telephone calls for at least 6 months. Main Results 33 cases (49.3\%) were postponed from one day to 6 months (range, one to 165 days; median, 8 days). The scheduled surgeries for 21 (31.3\%) patients were never performed; and 9 patients (13.4\%) died during their hospitalization (range, one to 20 days; mean, 12.7 days). Conclusions Surgery was postponed or cancelled in the OR mainly for changes in medical condition (70.2\%); either medical risk outweighed the benefits of surgery, or alternative treatments were used.},

Because of the inherent nature of an ambulatory surgery center, which only performs scheduled elective procedures, surgical cancellations typically result in wasted time and resources. Pediatric surgery cancellations can be mitigated with proper preoperative screening and communication between nurses and patients' guardians. To reduce the rate of cancellation at our pediatric ambulatory surgery center, we implemented a Nurse-Patient Preoperative Call Log. Preoperative nurses called patients or their guardians on two separate occasions during the two weeks before surgery~to review health history and instructions and answer questions about the upcoming surgery. Three months after~implementing the call log, surgery cancellation rates significantly decreased from~16.8\% to 8.8\% (P {$<$} .05).

The purpose of this study was to examine the epidemiologic patterns of anesthesia-related deaths at the national level. Methods We searched the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, manuals for codes specifically related to anesthesia/anesthetics. These codes were used to identify anesthesia-related deaths from the US multiple-cause-of-death data files for the years 1999\textendash 2005. Rates from anesthesia-related deaths were calculated based on population and hospital surgical discharge data. Results We identified 46 anesthesia/anesthetic codes, including complications of anesthesia during pregnancy, labor, and puerperium (O29.0\textendash O29.9, O74.0\textendash 74.9, O89.0\textendash O89.9), overdose of anesthetics (T41.0\textendash T41.4), adverse effects of anesthetics in therapeutic use (Y45.0, Y47.1, Y48.0\textendash Y48.4, Y55.1), and other complications of anesthesia (T88.2\textendash T88.5, Y65.3). Of the 2,211 recorded anesthesia-related deaths in the United States during 1999\textendash 2005, 46.6\% were attributable to overdose of anesthetics, 42.5\% to adverse effects of anesthetics in therapeutic use, 3.6\% to complications of anesthesia during pregnancy, labor, and puerperium, and 7.3\% to other complications of anesthesia. The estimated rates from anesthesia-related deaths were 1.1 per million population per year (1.45 for males and 0.77 for females) and 8.2 per million hospital surgical discharges (11.7 for men and 6.5 for women). The highest death rates were found in persons aged 85 years and older. Conclusion Each year in the United States, anesthesia/anesthetics are reported as the underlying cause in approximately 34 deaths and contributing factors in another 281 deaths, with excess mortality risk in the elderly and men.},

Enhanced Recovery After Surgery process implementation involves a team consisting of surgeons, anesthetists, an ERAS coordinator (often a nurse or a physician assistant), and staff from units that care for the surgical patient. The care protocol is based on published evidence. The ERAS Society, an international nonprofit professional society that promotes, develops, and implements ERAS programs, publishes updated guidelines for many operations, such as evidence-based modern care changes from overnight fasting to carbohydrate drinks 2 hours before surgery, minimally invasive approaches instead of large incisions, management of fluids to seek balance rather than large volumes of intravenous fluids, avoidance of or early removal of drains and tubes, early mobilization, and serving of drinks and food the day of the operation. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocols have resulted in shorter length of hospital stay by 30\% to 50\% and similar reductions in complications, while readmissions and costs are reduced. The elements of the protocol reduce the stress of the operation to retain anabolic homeostasis. The ERAS Society conducts structured implementation programs that are currently in use in more than 20 countries. Local ERAS teams from hospitals are trained to implement ERAS processes.

The compartmental flow model provides the opportunity for improved decision-making about bed occupancy decisions, particularly those of a strategic nature. This modelling can be applied to complement infrastructure and workforce-planning methods. Discussion about appropriateness of the level of model complexity, the degree of fit and the ability to use compartmental flow models for generalization and forecasting has been lacking. The authors investigated model selection and assessment in relation to hospital bed compartment flow models. A compartment model for a range of scenarios was created. The training and test data related to the 1998 and 1999 calendar years, respectively. The majority of scenarios tested were based upon commonly used periods that describe periods of time. The goodness-of-fit achieved by optimisation was measured against the training and test data. Model fit improved with increasing complexity as expected. The analysis of model fit against the test data showed that increasing model complexity did result in over-fitting, and better prediction was achieved with a relatively simple model. In terms of generalisation, the seasonal models performed best. Single day census type models, which have been used by Millard and his colleagues, were also generated. The performance of these models was similar, but inferior to that of the models generated from a full year of training data. The additional data make the models better able to capture the variation across the year in activity.},

Methods: A prospective series of 1077 consecutive patients undergoing major hepatobiliary or gastrointestinal surgery were studied. Patients having elective (n = 827) and emergency (n = 250) procedures were included. The surgeon predicted the development of postoperative complications immediately after completion of surgery on a scale from 0 to 100 per cent. These predictions were compared with the actual outcome and with predictions made using the Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality and morbidity (POSSUM). The Portsmouth predictor equation (P-POSSUM) was applied for the estimation of mortality. Results: The observed morbidity and mortality rates were 29{$\cdot$}5 and 3{$\cdot$}4 per cent respectively. POSSUM predicted a morbidity rate of 46{$\cdot$}4 per cent and P-POSSUM a mortality rate of 6{$\cdot$}9 per cent. The surgeon's gut-feeling was more accurate in the prediction of morbidity at 32{$\cdot$}1 per cent. On the basis of gut-feeling, surgeons overpredicted morbidity in elective surgery, but underestimated the risk of complications in the emergency setting. The (P)-POSSUM scoring system overpredicted morbidity and mortality for elective and emergency operations. Conclusion: The surgeon's gut-feeling is a good predictor of postoperative outcome, especially after elective surgery. (P)-POSSUM overpredicted morbidity and mortality in this series of major gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary operations. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2005 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd.

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Accurate peri-operative risk prediction is an essential element of clinical practice. Various risk stratification tools for assessing patients' risk of mortality or morbidity have been developed and applied in clinical practice over the years. This review aims to outline essential characteristics (predictive accuracy, objectivity, clinical utility) of currently available risk scoring tools for hip fracture patients. METHODS: We searched eight databases; AMED, CINHAL, Clinical Trials.gov, Cochrane, DARE, EMBASE, MEDLINE and Web of Science for all relevant studies published until April 2015. We included published English language observational studies that considered the predictive accuracy of risk stratification tools for patients with fragility hip fracture. RESULTS: After removal of duplicates, 15,620 studies were screened. Twenty-nine papers met the inclusion criteria, evaluating 25 risk stratification tools. Risk stratification tools considered in more than two studies were; ASA, CCI, E-PASS, NHFS and O-POSSUM. All tools were moderately accurate and validated in multiple studies; however there are some limitations to consider. The E-PASS and O-POSSUM are comprehensive but complex, and require intraoperative data making them a challenge for use on patient bedside. The ASA, CCI and NHFS are simple, easy and inexpensive using routinely available preoperative data. Contrary to the ASA and CCI which has subjective variables in addition to other limitations, the NHFS variables are all objective. CONCLUSION: In the search for a simple and inexpensive, easy to calculate, objective and accurate tool, the NHFS may be the most appropriate of the currently available scores for hip fracture patients. However more studies need to be undertaken before it becomes a national hip fracture risk stratification or audit tool of choice.},

  abstract = {Postoperative hospital stay is longer for frail, older patients, who are more likely to experience prolonged postoperative morbidity and reduced long-term survival. We recorded in-hospital mortality, morbidity and length of stay for 164 patients aged at least 65 years after unscheduled surgery. We evaluated pre-operative frailty with the 7-point Clinical Frailty Scale: 81 patients were `not vulnerable' (frailty score 1\textendash 3) and 83 were `vulnerable or frail' (frailty score 4), with mean (SD) ages of 74.7 (7.5) years vs. 79.4 (8.3) years, respectively, p {$<$} 0.001. Within 30 postoperative days 8/164 (5\%) patients died, all with frailty scores 4, p = 0.007. Postoperative morbidity was less frequent in patients categorised as `not vulnerable' on four out of the six days it was measured (days 3, 5, 8, 14, 23, 28). Median (IQR [range]) postoperative stay was 9 (6\textendash 18 [2\textendash 221]) days for patients with frailty scores 1\textendash 3, and 22 (12\textendash 33 [2\textendash 270]) days for patients with score 4, p {$<$} 0.001. Four variables independently associated with hospital discharge, hazard ratio (95\%CI): E-POSSUM, 0.74 (0.60\textendash 0.92), p = 0.007; ASA 2, 0.35 (0.13\textendash 0.98), p = 0.046, ASA 3, 0.17 (0.06\textendash 0.47), p = 0.001 and ASA 4/5, 0.08 (0.02\textendash 0.28), p {$<$} 0.001; operative severity `major +', 0.69 (0.41\textendash 1.08), p = 0.10 and the Surgical Outcome Risk Tool, 7.75 (0.81\textendash 74.40), p = 0.08.},

Summary Background Data:~Currently, preoperative assessment of surgical risk is largely based on subjective clinician experience. We propose a paradigm shift from the current postoperative risk adjustment for cross-hospital comparison to patient-centered quantitative risk assessment during the preoperative evaluation.         Methods:~We identify the most common and important predictor variables of postoperative mortality, overall morbidity, and 6 complication clusters from previously published prediction analyses that used forward selection stepwise logistic regression. We then refit the prediction models using only the 8 most common and important predictor variables, and compare the discrimination and calibration of these models to the original full-variable models using the c-index, Hosmer-Lemeshow analysis, and Brier scores.         Results:~Accurate risk models for 30-day outcomes of mortality, overall morbidity, and 6 clusters of complications were developed using a set of 8 preoperative risk variables. C-indexes of the 8 variable models are between 97.9\% and 99.2\% of those of the full models containing up to 28 variables, indicating excellent discrimination using fewer predictor variables. Hosmer-Lemeshow analyses showed observed to expected event rates to be nearly identical between parsimonious models and full models, both showing good calibration.         Conclusions:~Accurate preoperative risk assessment of postoperative mortality, overall morbidity, and 6 complication clusters in a broad surgical population can be achieved with as few as 8 preoperative predictor variables, improving feasibility of routine preoperative risk assessment for surgical patients.},

The aim of this study was to present measures of variation appropriate for the logistic case in a didactic rather than a mathematical way. Design and participants Data were used from the health survey conducted in 2000 in the county of Scania, Sweden, that comprised 10\,723 persons aged 18\textendash 80 years living in 60 areas. Conducting multilevel logistic regression different techniques were applied to investigate whether the individual propensity to consult private physicians was statistically dependent on the area of residence (that is, intraclass correlation (ICC), median odds ratio (MOR)), the 80\% interval odds ratio (IOR-80), and the sorting out index). Results The MOR provided more interpretable information than the ICC on the relevance of the residential area for understanding the individual propensity of consulting private physicians. The MOR showed that the unexplained heterogeneity between areas was of greater relevance than the individual variables considered in the analysis (age, sex, and education) for understanding the individual propensity of visiting private physicians. Residing in a high education area increased the probability of visiting a private physician. However, the IOR showed that the unexplained variability between areas did not allow to clearly distinguishing low from high propensity areas with the area educational level. The sorting out index was equal to 82\%. Conclusion Measures of variation in logistic regression should be promoted in social epidemiological and public health research as efficient means of quantifying the importance of the context of residence for understanding disparities in health and health related behaviour.},

Furthermore, by analysing the fluctuating pattern of weekly admissions we show how weekends and the Christmas holiday periods impact on bed usage. Next, we demonstrate that flow process models can be used to describe how the in-patient workload concerns two groups of patients. On an average day, 71.4\% of the beds contained patients who will have an average (exponential) stay of 4.8 days, and the other beds, 28.6\%, contain patients who will have an average (exponential) stay of 22.8 days. The article concludes by demonstrating the short and long-term impact on daily admissions of a 10\% change in four different parameters of the model.

The Middle East and Europe were distinct geographically, linguistically, and theologically, but the theory that underpinned the understanding of medieval medicine was the same since both regions followed the humoural theory of the ancient Greeks. Despite the known differences between medieval Europe and the Middle East, there was considerable movement of people, translation of medical texts, and practical interaction between medical practitioners from both regions, especially at the time of the crusades. This complex interaction allows us to consider the flow of ideas between cultures, and to compare and contrast how these differing cultures led to variation in the practice of anatomical dissection and surgery.},

Two of the measures (squared Pearson correlation between the binary outcome and the predictor, and the proportional reduction of squared Pearson residuals by the use of covariates) give almost identical results, agree very well with the multiple R2 of the general linear model, have an intuitively clear interpretation and perform satisfactorily in our study. For all measures the explained variation for the given sample and also the one expected in future samples can be obtained easily.

It is estimated that {$>$}230 million surgical procedures are performed each year, with an estimated mortality of at least 0.4\% and morbidity of between 3\% and 17\%. Furthermore, there are potentially far-reaching consequences of a complicated perioperative course, because perioperative morbidity is associated with reduced long-term survival. In this review, we examine the factors that are associated with surgical outcomes. Issues related to the delivery of health care, such as structure, process, and resource utilization, have been shown to vary within and between institutions, leading to differences in both morbidity and mortality after surgery. Patient-related factors, in particular comorbid illness, functional capacity, and cardiovascular health, are also related to perioperative risk, and may be assessed using risk stratification models, exercise testing, and biomarker assays. The strengths and weaknesses of each of these techniques are discussed. We also review the strengths and limitations of the measures used to assess outcome after surgery, including patient-centered variables such as mortality and morbidity scores, and patient-related outcome measures. Finally, we suggest the direction of future work, which should be aimed at improving the precision of tools for describing perioperative risk, and of the measures used to assess the outcomes and quality of surgical health care. These tools are the building blocks of high-quality clinical trials, epidemiological studies, and quality improvement programs.},

The example was originally set by the Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons who have been publishing individualised risk-adjusted outcome data for cardiac surgeons for over a decade. In association with this endeavour, they have seen a significant improvement in outcomes as well as being justifiably applauded by the public and the profession for their transparency.1 Now, data collected in publicly funded Healthcare Quality Improvement Program National Clinical Audits are being analysed on a surgeon-by-surgeon basis for eight other surgical specialties. This is an important step in improving transparency of outcomes and hopefully a first step in quality improvement; however, there are a number of limitations to this approach which merit consideration. First, the numbers of cases for each surgeon are not high enough to enable the comparison of outcomes to be sufficiently powered to detect poor performers.2 Second, the outcome which is being compared is usually short-term (inpatient, 30-day or 90-day) mortality. In terms of important patient-centred outcomes, short-term mortality is only the tip of the iceberg. Postoperative complications, which are far more prevalent, are also associated with significant longer term sequelae. There is convincing evidence of an independent association between postoperative complications and reduced long-term survival, even after adjusting for premorbid risk factors.3 Complications are associated with prolonged hospitalisation4 and delay in return to work, both of which carry an enormous health economic burden. Health-related quality of life is known to be reduced for years in patients who endure a complicated postoperative course compared with those who do not.5 Increasingly, in perioperative medicine trials there is interest in using longer-term endpoints such as disability-free survival at 1\hspace{0.25em}year to fully capture the impact of \ldots},

  abstract = {Introduction The admission of high-risk patients to critical care after surgery is a recommended standard of care. Nevertheless, poor compliance against this recommendation has been repeatedly demonstrated in large epidemiological studies. It is unclear whether this is due to reasons of capacity, equipoise, poor quality clinical care or because hospitals are working creatively to create capacity for augmented care on normal surgical wards. The EPIdemiology of Critical Care after Surgery study aims to address these uncertainties. Methods and analysis One-week observational cohort study in the UK and Australasia. All patients undergoing inpatient (overnight stay) surgery will be included. All will have prospective data collection on risk factors, surgical procedure and postoperative outcomes including the primary outcome of morbidity (measured using the Postoperative Morbidity Survey on day 7 after surgery) and secondary outcomes including length of stay and mortality. Data will also be collected on critical care referral and admission, surgical cancellations and critical care occupancy. The epidemiology of patient characteristics, processes and outcomes will be described. Inferential techniques (multilevel multivariable regression, propensity score matching and instrumental variable analysis) will be used to evaluate the relationship between critical care admission and postoperative outcome. Ethics and dissemination The study has received ethical approval from the National Research Ethics Service in the UK and equivalent in Australasia. The collection of patient identifiable data without prior consent has been approved by the Confidentiality Advisory Group (England and Wales) and the Public Privacy and Patient Benefit Panel (Scotland). In these countries, patient identifiable data will be used to link prospectively collected data with national registers of death and inpatient administrative data. The study findings will be disseminated using a multimedia approach with the support of our lay collaborators, to patients, public, policy-makers, clinical and academic audiences.},

  abstract = {Background Previous studies have suggested that there may be long-term harm associated with postoperative complications. Uncertainty exists however, because of the need for risk adjustment and inconsistent definitions of postoperative morbidity. Methods We did a longitudinal observational cohort study of patients undergoing major surgery. Case-mix adjustment was applied and morbidity was recorded using a validated outcome measure. Cox proportional hazards modelling using time-dependent covariates was used to measure the independent relationship between prolonged postoperative morbidity and longer term survival. Results Data were analysed for 1362 patients. The median length of stay was 9 days and the median follow-up time was 6.5 yr. Independent of perioperative risk, postoperative neurological morbidity (prevalence 2.9\%) was associated with a relative hazard for long-term mortality of 2.00 [P=0.001; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.32\textendash 3.04]. Prolonged postoperative morbidity (prevalence 15.6\%) conferred a relative hazard for death in the first 12 months after surgery of 3.51 (P{$<$}0.001; 95\% CI 2.28\textendash 5.42) and for the next 2 yr of 2.44 (P{$<$}0.001; 95\% CI 1.62\textendash 3.65), returning to baseline thereafter. Conclusions Prolonged morbidity after surgery is associated with a risk of premature death for a longer duration than perhaps is commonly thought; however, this risk falls with time. We suggest that prolonged postoperative morbidity measured in this way may be a valid indicator of the quality of surgical healthcare. Our findings reinforce the importance of research and quality improvement initiatives aimed at reducing the duration and severity of postoperative complications.},

  abstract = {Background Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is used as a preoperative risk-stratification tool for patients undergoing non-cardiopulmonary intra-abdominal surgery. Previous studies indicate that CPET may be beneficial, but research is needed to quantify CPET values protective against poor postoperative outcome [mortality, morbidity, and length of stay (LOS)]. Methods This systematic review aimed to assess the ability of CPET to predict postoperative outcome. The following databases were searched: PubMed, EMBASE, PEDro, The Cochrane Library, Cinahl, and AMED. Thirty-seven full-text articles were included. Data extraction included the following: author, patient characteristics, setting, surgery type, postoperative outcome measure, and CPET outcomes. Results Surgeries reviewed were hepatic transplant and resection (n+7), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (n+5), colorectal (n+6), pancreatic (n+4), renal transplant (n+2), upper gastrointestinal (n+4), bariatric (n+2), and general intra-abdominal surgery (n+12). Cardiopulmonary exercise testing-derived cut-points, peak oxygen consumption ( V\textperiodcentered O2\textbackslash,peak), and anaerobic threshold (AT) predicted the following postoperative outcomes: 90 day\textendash 3 yr survival (AT 9\textendash 11 ml kg-1 min-1) and intensive care unit admission (AT {$<$}9.9\textendash 11 ml kg-1 min-1) after hepatic transplant and resection, 90 day survival after AAA repair ( V\textperiodcentered O2\textbackslash,peak 15 ml kg-1 min-1), LOS and morbidity after pancreatic surgery (AT {$<$}10\textendash 10.1 ml kg-1 min-1), and mortality and morbidity after intra-abdominal surgery (AT 10.9 and {$<$}10.1 ml kg-1 min-1, respectively). Conclusion Cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a useful preoperative risk-stratification tool that can predict postoperative outcome. Further research is needed to justify the ability of CPET to predict postoperative outcome in renal transplant, colorectal, upper gastrointestinal, and bariatric surgery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing mortality for patients admitted to hospitals during the weekend is a contentious but well described phenomenon. However, it remains uncertain whether adverse outcomes, including prolonged hospital length-of-stay (LOS), may also occur after patients undergoing major planned surgery are admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) out-of-office-hours, either during weeknights (after 18:00) or on weekends. METHODS: All planned surgical admissions requiring admission to one of 183 ICUs across Australia and New Zealand between 2006 and 2016 were included in this retrospective population-based cohort study. Primary outcomes were hospital LOS and hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of the total 504 713 planned postoperative ICU admissions, 33.6\% occurred during out-of-office-hours. After adjusting for available risk factors, out-of-office-hours ICU admissions were associated with a significant increase in hospital LOS [+2.6 days, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.5-2.6], mortality [odd ratio (OR) 1.5, 95\%CI 1.4-1.6], and a reduced chance of being directly discharged home (OR 0.8, 95\%CI 0.8-0.8). The strongest association for adverse outcomes occurred with weekend ICU admissions (hospital LOS:~+3.0 days, 95\%CI 3.2-3.6; hospital mortality: OR 1.7, 95\%CI 1.6-1.8). Clustering of adverse outcomes by hospitals was not observed in the generalised estimating equation analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a greater clinical staff availability and higher monitoring levels, planned surgery requiring anticipated out-of-office-hours ICU admission was associated with a prolonged hospital LOS, reduced discharge directly home, and increased mortality compared with in-office-hours admissions. Our findings have potential clinical, economic and health policy implications on how complex planned surgery should be planned and managed.},

  abstract = {BackgroundWith increasing rates of bariatric surgery and the consequential involvement of increasingly complex patients, uncertainty remains regarding the use of intensive care unit (ICU) services after bariatric surgery. Our objective was to define the incidence, indications, and outcomes of patients requiring ICU admission after bariatric surgery and assess whether unplanned ICU admission could be predicted using preoperative factors.MethodsAll adult bariatric surgery patients between 2007 and 2011 in Western Australia were identified from the Department of Health Data Linkage Unit database and merged with a separate database encompassing all subsequent ICU admissions pertaining to bariatric surgery. The minimal and mean follow-up periods were 12 months and 3.4 yr, respectively.ResultsOf the 12 062 patients who underwent bariatric surgery during the study period, 590 patients (4.9\%; 650 ICU admissions) were admitted to an ICU after their bariatric surgery. Patients admitted to the ICU were older (48 vs 43 yr, P\&lt;0.001), more likely to be male (49.7 vs 20.2\%, P\&lt;0.001), and more likely to require revisional bariatric surgery (14.4 vs 7.1\%, P\&lt;0.001). One hundred and seventy-six patients required an emergent unplanned ICU admission, with 51 requiring multiple ICU admissions. Revisional or open surgery, diabetes mellitus, chronic respiratory disease, and obstructive apnoea were the strongest preoperative factors associated with unplanned ICU admission.ConclusionsIntensive care unit admission after bariatric surgery was uncommon (4.9\% of all patients), with 30.9\% of all referrals being unplanned. A nomogram and smartphone application based on five important preoperative factors may assist anaesthetists to conduct preoperative planning for high-risk bariatric surgical patients.},

It increases costs of running theatres, is a financial burden and emotional strain on patients and their families. METHOD: A retrospective study where 300 cancellations in the Department of Surgery were randomly selected and analysed from the Morbidity and Mortality meetings held at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital from November 2015. RESULTS: Of the 1554 elective cases booked during the period under review, there were 294 cancellations resulting in a cancellation rate of 18.9\%. Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy was the most common procedure (31.8\%) cancelled. The most common reason for cancellation (50\%) was time constraints. Administrative related reasons for cancellation were the most common (85\%) encountered. The majority of cancellations were judged to be the event of an Unavoidable reason. The majority of the patients cancelled were ASA II and ASA III (77\%). The ASA score had no significance on medical related cancellations. CONCLUSION: We reported a comparatively high cancellation rate. Further prospective studies need to be conducted to critically evaluate the reasons behind lack of operative time as the majority of the reasons for cancellation could be potentially avoidable.},

  abstract = {Observational studies assessing the effect of a particular treatment or exposure may be subject to bias, which can be difficult to eliminate using standard analytic techniques. Multivariable models are commonly used in observational research to assess the relationship between a certain exposure or treatment and an outcome, while adjusting for important variables necessary to ensure comparability between the groups. Large differences in the observed covariates between two study groups may exist in observational studies in which the investigator has no control over who was allocated to each treatment group, and these differences may lead to biased estimates of treatment effect. When there are large differences in important prognostic characteristics between the treatment groups, adjusting for these differences with conventional multivariable techniques may not adequately balance the groups, and the remaining bias may limit valid causal inference. Use of a propensity score, described as a conditional probability that a subject will be ``treated'' based on an observed group of covariates, may better adjust covariates between the groups and reduce bias. The purpose of this article is to describe the use of propensity scores to adjust for bias when estimating treatment effects in observational research and to compare use of this technique with conventional multivariable regression. The authors present three methods for integrating propensity scores into observational analyses using a database collected on head-injured trauma patients. The article details the methods for creating a propensity score, analyzing data with the score, and explores differences between propensity score methods and conventional multivariable methods, including potential benefits and limitations. Graphical representations of the analyses are provided as well.},

  abstract = {The Critical Care Minimum Data Set was developed by the Critical Care Information Advisory Group (CCIAG) and endorsed by the Intensive Care Society. The Critical Care Minimum Data Set contains a subset of mandatory items for the generation of Critical Care Healthcare Resource Groups (HRGs). The Critical Care HRG subset replaced the Augmented Care Period data elements in the Commissioning Data Sets. The purpose of the Critical Care Minimum Data Set is to provide a standardised set of data to support National Tariff Payment System, Healthcare Resource Groups, Resource Management, Commissioning and national policy analysis. The full Critical Care Minimum Data Set has been incorporated into and is consistent with the ICNARC (Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre) data collection. The Critical Care Minimum Data Set has been developed to be used in all units where Critical Care is provided. That is where the CRITICAL CARE LEVEL is National Code: 02 Patients requiring more detailed observation or intervention including support for a single failing organ system or post-operative care and those 'stepping down' from higher levels of care or 03 Patients requiring advanced respiratory support alone or monitoring and support for two or more organ systems. This level includes all complex patients requiring support for multi-organ failure. Neonates are excluded from the data set. The recording of Critical Care Minimum Data Set for older babies (over 28 days) on Neonatal and Paediatric Intensive Care Units is optional. However, the activity for children treated on adult critical care units should be recorded.}

  abstract = {Background Studies across healthcare systems have demonstrated between-hospital variation in survival after an emergency laparotomy. We postulate that this variation can be explained by differences in perioperative process delivery, underpinning organisational structures, and associated hospital characteristics. Methods We performed this nationwide, registry-based, prospective cohort study using data from the National Emergency Laparotomy Audit organisational and patient audit data sets. Outcome measures were all-cause 30- and 90-day postoperative mortality. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for perioperative processes and organisational structures and characteristics by fitting multilevel logistic regression models. Results The cohort comprised 39 903 patients undergoing surgery at 185 hospitals. Controlling for case mix and clustering, a substantial proportion of between-hospital mortality variation was explained by differences in processes, infrastructure, and hospital characteristics. Perioperative care pathways [OR: 0.86; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.76\textendash 0.96; and OR: 0.89; 95\% CI: 0.81\textendash 0.99] and emergency surgical units (OR: 0.89; 95\% CI: 0.80\textendash 0.99; and OR: 0.89; 95\% CI: 0.81\textendash 0.98) were associated with reduced 30- and 90-day mortality, respectively. In contrast, infrequent consultant-delivered intraoperative care was associated with increased 30- and 90-day mortality (OR: 1.61; 95\% CI: 1.01\textendash 2.56; and OR: 1.61; 95\% CI: 1.08\textendash 2.39, respectively). Postoperative geriatric medicine review was associated with substantially lower mortality in older ({$\geq$}70 yr) patients (OR: 0.35; 95\% CI: 0.29\textendash 0.42; and OR: 0.64; 95\% CI: 0.55\textendash 0.73, respectively). Conclusions This multicentre study identified low-technology, readily implementable structures and processes that are associated with improved survival after an emergency laparotomy.

  abstract = {Emergency laparotomies are performed commonly throughout the world, but one in six patients die within a month of surgery. Current international initiatives to reduce the considerable associated morbidity and mortality are founded upon delivering individualised perioperative care. However, while the identification of high-risk patients requires the routine assessment of individual risk, no method of doing so has been demonstrated to be practical and reliable across the commonly encountered spectrum of presentations, co-morbidities and operative procedures. A systematic review of Embase and Medline identified 20 validation studies assessing 25 risk assessment tools in patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. The most frequently studied general tools were APACHE II, ASA-PS and P-POSSUM. Comparative, quantitative analysis of tool performance was not feasible due to the heterogeneity of study design, poor reporting and infrequent within-study statistical comparison of tool performance. Reporting of calibration was notably absent in many prognostic tool validation studies. APACHE II demonstrated the most consistent discrimination of individual outcome across a variety of patient groups undergoing emergency laparotomy when used either preoperatively or postoperatively (area under the curve 0.76\textendash 0.98). While APACHE systems were designed for use in critical care, the ability of APACHE II to generate individual risk estimates from objective, exclusively preoperative data items may lead to better-informed shared decisions, triage and perioperative management of patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. Future endeavours should include the recalibration of APACHE II and P-POSSUM in contemporary cohorts, modifications to enable prediction of morbidity and assessment of the impact of adoption of these tools on clinical practice and patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Structured preoperative assessment has been reported to improve operating room efficiency as measured by metrics such as day of surgery cancellations (DOSCs). However, not all patients require comprehensive assessment; routine full assessments can result in unnecessary duplication of tests and investigations. Selective nurse screening under the supervision of anesthesiology may provide adequate information gathering in lower risk patients. This study is undertaken to assess if DOSC rates vary with different assessment processes. METHODS: At a single academic tertiary care hospital, from Jan 2 to May 31, 2013, the consecutive patients undergoing comprehensive preoperative assessment (CPA) and nurse screening (NS), as well as the patients not assessed by the anesthesiology-supervised preoperative process, were followed for the occurrence and reason for DOSC. The operating room schedule of all elective surgery patients was analyzed to allow calculation of rates of DOSCs. Reasons for cancellations were documented as one of ten structured reasons by preoperative holding area clerical staff. RESULTS: Overall, there were 14,893 elective surgery patients in this time period, with 183 DOSCs, giving a rate of 1.23~\% (95~\% CI 1.06, 1.42). Patients who received CPA numbered 5980; 29 of them had a DOSC, giving a rate of 0.48~\% (95~\% CI 0.33-0.70) (P\,{$<$}\,0.0001 vs. no assessment). Patients receiving NS numbered 1840; 11 of them had a DOSC, giving a rate of 0.60~\% (95~\% CI 0.30-1.10) (P\,{$<$}\,0.0001 vs. no assessment). The most common reason for cancellation was new medical condition. CONCLUSIONS: A very low DOSC rate can be achieved with a comprehensive preoperative process where some patients are selectively telephone screened by nurses, with complete assessment deferred to the anesthesiologist on the day of surgery.},

Systematic reviews, RCTs not included in the systematic reviews, economic evaluations and UK NHS cost analysis, implementation case studies and surveys of patient experience in a UK setting were eligible for inclusion. Primary and secondary outcome measures We assessed the impact of enhanced recovery programmes on health or cost-related outcomes, and assessed implementation case studies and patient experience in UK settings. Studies were quality assessed where appropriate using the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects critical appraisal process. Results 17 systematic reviews and 12 additional RCTs were included. Ten relevant economic evaluations were included. No cost analysis studies were identified. Most of the evidence focused on colorectal surgery. 14 innovation case studies and 15 implementation case studies undertaken in National Health Service settings described factors critical to the success of an enhanced recovery programme. Evidence for colorectal surgery suggests that enhanced recovery programmes may reduce hospital stays by 0.5\textendash 3.5 days compared with conventional care. There were no significant differences in reported readmission rates. Other surgical specialties showed greater variation in reductions in length of stay reflecting the limited evidence identified. Findings relating to other outcomes were hampered by a lack of robust evidence and poor reporting. Conclusions There is consistent, albeit limited, evidence that enhanced recovery programmes can reduce length of patient hospital stay without increasing readmission rates. The extent to which managers and clinicians considering implementing enhanced recovery programmes in UK settings can realise savings will depend on length of stay achieved under their existing care pathway.},

  abstract = {Overdispersion is a common problem in count data. It can occur due to extra population-heterogeneity, omission of key predictors, and outliers. Unless properly handled, this can lead to invalid inference. Our goal is to assess the differential performance of methods for dealing with overdispersion from several sources. We considered six different approaches: unadjusted Poisson regression (Poisson), deviance-scale-adjusted Poisson regression (DS-Poisson), Pearson-scale-adjusted Poisson regression (PS-Poisson), negative-binomial regression (NB), and two generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with random intercept, log-link and Poisson (Poisson-GLMM) and negative-binomial (NB-GLMM) distributions. To rank order the preference of the models, we used Akaike's information criteria/Bayesian information criteria values, standard error, and 95\% confidence-interval coverage of the parameter values. To compare these methods, we used simulated count data with overdispersion of different magnitude from three different sources. Mean of the count response was associated with three predictors. Data from two real-case studies are also analyzed. The simulation results showed that NB and NB-GLMM were preferred for dealing with overdispersion resulting from any of the sources we considered. Poisson and DS-Poisson often produced smaller standard-error estimates than expected, while PS-Poisson conversely produced larger standard-error estimates. Thus, it is good practice to compare several model options to determine the best method of modeling count data.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Goal-directed therapy (GDT) has been shown to improve outcome when commenced before surgery. This requires pre-operative admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). In cardiac surgery, GDT has proved effective when commenced after surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of post-operative GDT on the incidence of complications and duration of hospital stay in patients undergoing general surgery. METHODS: This was a randomised controlled trial with concealed allocation. High-risk general surgical patients were allocated to post-operative GDT to attain an oxygen delivery index of 600 ml min(-1) m(-2) or to conventional management. Cardiac output was measured by lithium indicator dilution and pulse power analysis. Patients were followed up for 60 days. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were randomised to GDT and 60 patients to control treatment. The GDT group received more intravenous colloid (1,907 SD +/- 878 ml versus 1,204 SD +/- 898 ml; p {$<$} 0.0001) and dopexamine (55 patients (89\%) versus 1 patient (2\%); p {$<$} 0.0001). Fewer GDT patients developed complications (27 patients (44\%) versus 41 patients (68\%); p = 0.003, relative risk 0.63; 95\% confidence intervals 0.46 to 0.87). The number of complications per patient was also reduced (0.7 SD +/- 0.9 per patient versus 1.5 SD +/- 1.5 per patient; p = 0.002). The median duration of hospital stay in the GDT group was significantly reduced (11 days (IQR 7 to 15) versus 14 days (IQR 11 to 27); p = 0.001). There was no significant difference in mortality (seven patients (11.3\%) versus nine patients (15\%); p = 0.59). CONCLUSION: Post-operative GDT is associated with reductions in post-operative complications and duration of hospital stay. The beneficial effects of GDT may be achieved while avoiding the difficulties of pre-operative ICU admission.},

  abstract = {Introduction Little is known about mortality rates following general surgical procedures in the United Kingdom. Deaths are most common in the 'high-risk' surgical population consisting mainly of older patients, with coexisting medical disease, who undergo major surgery. Only limited data are presently available to describe this population. The aim of the present study was to estimate the size of the high-risk general surgical population and to describe the outcome and intensive care unit (ICU) resource use. Methods Data on inpatient general surgical procedures and ICU admissions in 94 National Health Service hospitals between January 1999 and October 2004 were extracted from the Intensive Care National Audit \& Research Centre database and the CHKS database. High-risk surgical procedures were defined prospectively as those for which the mortality rate was 5\% or greater. Results There were 4,117,727 surgical procedures; 2,893,432 were elective (12,704 deaths; 0.44\%) and 1,224,295 were emergencies (65,674 deaths; 5.4\%). A high-risk population of 513,924 patients was identified (63,340 deaths; 12.3\%), which accounted for 83.8\% of deaths but for only 12.5\% of procedures. This population had a prolonged hospital stay (median, 16 days; interquartile range, 9\textendash 29 days). There were 59,424 ICU admissions (11,398 deaths; 19\%). Among admissions directly to the ICU following surgery, there were 31,633 elective admissions with 3,199 deaths (10.1\%) and 24,764 emergency admissions with 7,084 deaths (28.6\%). The ICU stays were short (median, 1.6 days; interquartile range, 0.8\textendash 3.7 days) but hospital admissions for those admitted to the ICU were prolonged (median, 16 days; interquartile range, 10\textendash 30 days). Among the ICU population, 40.8\% of deaths occurred after the initial discharge from the ICU. The highest mortality rate (39\%) occurred in the population admitted to the ICU following initial postoperative care on a standard ward. Conclusion A large high-risk surgical population accounts for 12.5\% of surgical procedures but for more than 80\% of deaths. Despite high mortality rates, fewer than 15\% of these patients are admitted to the ICU.},

Around 15\% of people who undergo inpatient surgery are at high risk of complications, such as pneumonia or myocardial infarction, because of age, comorbid disease, or the complexity of the surgical procedure.1 2 High risk surgical patients account for 80\% of all perioperative deaths. Non-cardiac surgery is an important cause of death and disability, owing to the high volume of procedures and related adverse outcomes.1 2 3 4 5 6 Around 250 million major surgical procedures are performed worldwide each year.3 This number is increasing as gross domestic product rises in poorer countries.3 Assuming a hospital mortality rate of 1\%, non-cardiac surgery will be associated with 2.5 million deaths worldwide each year and complication rates at least five times this figure.1 2 3 4 5 6 Patients who survive postoperative complications commonly experience functional limitations and reduced long term survival.4 5 6 Varying mortality rates between hospitals indicate the potential and the need to improve survival after surgery.7 However, the reasons for the variation in mortality are not fully understood, making effective planning more \ldots},

  abstract = {Aim Prompted by high refused admission rates, we sought to model demand for our 20 bed paediatric intensive care unit. Methods We analysed activity (admissions) and demand (admissions plus refused admissions). The recommended method for calculating the required number of intensive care beds assumes a Poisson distribution based upon the size of the local catchment population, the incidence of intensive care admission and the average length of stay. We compared it to the Monte Carlo method which would also include supra-regional referrals not otherwise accounted for but which, due to their complexity, tend to have a longer stay than average. For the new method we assigned data from randomly selected emergency admissions to the refused admissions. We then compared occupancy scenarios obtained by random sampling from the data with replacement. Results There was an increase in demand for intensive care over time. Therefore, in order to provide an up-to-date model, we restricted the final analysis to data from the two most recent years (2327 admissions and 324 refused admissions). The conventional method suggested 27 beds covers 95\% of the year. The Monte Carlo method showed 95\% compliance with 34 beds, with seasonal variation quantified as 30 beds needed in the summer and 38 in the winter. Conclusion Both approaches suggest that the high refused admission rate is due to insufficient capacity. The Monte Carlo analysis is based upon the total workload (including supra-regional referrals) and predicts a greater bed requirement than the current recommended approach.},

  abstract = {Identification of key factors associated with the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and quantification of this risk using multivariable prediction algorithms are among the major advances made in preventive cardiology and cardiovascular epidemiology in the 20th century. The ongoing discovery of new risk markers by scientists presents opportunities and challenges for statisticians and clinicians to evaluate these biomarkers and to develop new risk formulations that incorporate them. One of the key questions is how best to assess and quantify the improvement in risk prediction offered by these new models. Demonstration of a statistically significant association of a new biomarker with cardiovascular risk is not enough. Some researchers have advanced that the improvement in the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) should be the main criterion, whereas others argue that better measures of performance of prediction models are needed. In this paper, we address this question by introducing two new measures, one based on integrated sensitivity and specificity and the other on reclassification tables. These new measures offer incremental information over the AUC. We discuss the properties of these new measures and contrast them with the AUC. We also develop simple asymptotic tests of significance. We illustrate the use of these measures with an example from the Framingham Heart Study. We propose that scientists consider these types of measures in addition to the AUC when assessing the performance of newer biomarkers.},

Standard methods, including statistical significance and c statistic are useful but not sufficient. Net reclassification improvement (NRI) offers a simple intuitive way of quantifying improvement offered by new markers and has been gaining popularity among researchers. However, several aspects of the NRI have not been studied in sufficient detail. In this paper we propose a prospective formulation for the NRI which offers immediate application to survival and competing risk data as well as allows for easy weighting with observed or perceived costs. We address the issue of the number and choice of categories and their impact on NRI. We contrast category-based NRI with one which is category-free and conclude that NRIs cannot be compared across studies unless they are defined in the same manner. We discuss the impact of differing event rates when models are applied to different samples or definitions of events and durations of follow-up vary between studies. We also show how NRI can be applied to case-control data. The concepts presented in the paper are illustrated in a Framingham Heart Study example. In conclusion, NRI can be readily calculated for survival, competing risk, and case-control data, is more objective and comparable across studies using the category-free version, and can include relative costs for classifications. We recommend that researchers clearly define and justify the choices they make when choosing NRI for their application.},

In addition, the operating surgeon made a risk assessment on a linear analogue scale before and immediately after operation. Major complications developed in 28 patients (25 per cent). Age, weight loss and relative weight did not select high risk patients, but patients with a serum albumin of 29 g/l developed significantly more complications than those with higher levels (60 versus 22 per cent, P less than 0.05). Clinical assessment also selected some high risk patients but patients selected by the surgeon's pre-operative assessment did not develop significantly more complications than those not selected (38 versus 21 per cent). However, the surgeon's postoperative assessment did select patients at significantly increased risk, especially when compared with his pre-operative assessment. Of 38 patients who were selected pre-operatively as high risk or who increased their risk ranking postoperatively, 20 (53 per cent) developed complications, as opposed to only 6 of 65 patients (9 per cent) who were low risk or decreased their risk ranking (P less than 0.001). The surgeons changed their ranking postoperatively in 44 patients and in 36 (82 per cent) the reason given was the technical ease or difficulty of the procedure. Using receiver-operating characteristic curves, immediate postoperative assessment was superior to any pre-operative method of selecting high risk patients. Of 15 patients with normal serum albumin levels whose risk ranking increased postoperatively 6 (40 per cent) developed complications while none of the 7 patients with low serum albumin (high risk) who decreased their risk ranking developed complications. It is concluded that operative performance is the main factor in the development of postoperative complications and should be assessed in future studies of outcome.},

The indices chosen had been used by others to identify high risk patients and they were compared with each other and with two clinical assessments of risk, one by the operating surgeon and the other by an independent clinician who performed a complete physical examination. Anthropometric indices did not pick out patients who were significantly at high risk but the plasma proteins (albumin, pre-albumin, transferrin) identified subgroups of high risk patients, about a third of whom developed major postoperative complications. Although some nutritional indicators which use plasma proteins for the computation selected patients who were significantly more at risk, some (20\textendash 30 per cent) of the patients with low levels of plasma proteins (particularly those who were septic) did not have depleted fat or muscle protein stores. Although the surgeons were able correctly to identify only a small number of very high risk patients the results showed that a carefully performed clinical examination was able to do this as effectively as the plasma proteins. It is suggested that something more than a global assessment by the operating surgeon is required to identify high risk patients. A careful assessment of medical risk noting in particular cardiorespiratory disease and pre-existing sepsis, as well as nutritional state, is as effective as any other currently used indicator of risk.},

  abstract = {Aims To compare the ability of the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) and the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) to identify patients at risk of in-hospital mortality and other adverse outcomes. Methods We undertook a multi-centre retrospective observational study at five acute hospitals from two UK NHS Trusts. Data were obtained from completed adult admissions who were not fit enough to be discharged alive on the day of admission. Diagnostic coding and oxygen prescriptions were used to identify patients with type II respiratory failure (T2RF). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality within 24\,h of a vital signs observation. Secondary outcomes included unanticipated intensive care unit admission or cardiac arrest within 24\,h of a vital signs observation. Discrimination was assessed using the c-statistic. Results Among 251,266 adult admissions, 48,898 were identified to be at risk of T2RF by diagnostic coding. In this group, NEWS2 showed statistically significant lower discrimination (c-statistic, 95\% CI) for identifying in-hospital mortality within 24\,h (0.860, 0.857\textendash 0.864) than NEWS (0.881, 0.878-0.884). For 1394 admissions with documented T2RF, discrimination was similar for both systems: NEWS2 (0.841, 0.827-0.855), NEWS (0.862, 0.848\textendash 0.875). For all secondary endpoints, NEWS2 showed no improvements in discrimination. Conclusions NEWS2 modifications to NEWS do not improve discrimination of adverse outcomes in patients with documented T2RF and decrease discrimination in patients at risk of T2RF. Further evaluation of the relationship between SpO2 values, oxygen therapy and risk should be investigated further before wide-scale adoption of NEWS2.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Early recognition and treatment of trauma patients requiring massive transfusion (MT) has been shown to reduce mortality. While many risk factors predicting MT have been demonstrated, there is no universally accepted method or algorithm to identify these patients. We hypothesised that even among experienced trauma surgeons, the clinical gestalt of identifying patients who will require MT is unreliable. METHODS: Transfusion and mortality outcomes after trauma were observed at 10 U.S. Level-1 trauma centres in patients who survived {$\geq$} 30 min after admission and received {$\geq$} 1 unit of RBC within 6h of arrival. Subjects who received {$\geq$} 10 units within 24h of admission were classified as MT patients. Trauma surgeons were asked the clinical gestalt question "Is the patient likely to be massively transfused?" 10 min after the patients arrival. The performance of clinical gestalt to predict MT was assessed using chi-square tests and ROC analysis to compare gestalt to previously described scoring systems. RESULTS: Of the 1245 patients enrolled, 966 met inclusion criteria and 221 (23\%) patients received MT. 415 (43\%) were predicted to have a MT and 551(57\%) were predicted to not have MT. Patients predicted to have MT were younger, more often sustained penetrating trauma, had higher ISS scores, higher heart rates, and lower systolic blood pressures (all p{$<$}0.05). Gestalt sensitivity was 65.6\% and specificity was 63.8\%. PPV and NPV were 34.9\% and 86.2\% respectively. CONCLUSION: Data from this large multicenter trial demonstrates that predicting the need for MT continues to be a challenge. Because of the increased mortality associated with delayed therapy, a more reliable algorithm is needed to identify and treat these severely injured patients earlier.},

  abstract = {Background To quantify severity of postoperative complications based on the Accordion Severity Grading System, determine the ability of severity grading to enhance National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) data, and develop an aggregate measure of severity of complications (the postoperative morbidity index). Study Design Forty-three surgical experts rated case vignettes containing postoperative complications on a severity scale. Vignettes were based on the Accordion Severity Grading System derived from the Toronto Severity Grading System. The system was adjusted using the expert severity scale results and applied to 1 year of NSQIP outcomes (1,857 patients, 704 complications) at a large tertiary care center. Results Experts initially distinguished the 6 grades of severity in a highly significant manner (t-test probabilities all \&lt; 0.005), with 1 exception. They rated reoperation and single-system organ failure without reoperation as similar, rather than distinct, in severity. The Accordion System was adjusted to reflect this. Distinction of grades thereafter was highly significant (t-test probabilities all \&lt; 0.005). Application to American College of Surgeons NSQIP data provided important novel insights. For example, complications in 6 American College of Surgeons NSQIP categories spanned 4 or more severity grades. Severity-weighted outcomes revealed that quantitatively the greatest burden of outcomes was due to wound infection, shock, and return to the operating room, which is not revealed by unweighted outcomes. Based on this information, an aggregate measure of severity of complications\textemdash the postoperative morbidity index\textemdash was proposed. Conclusions Quantitative severity weighting of complications is feasible. Adjustment of American College of Surgeons NSQIP outcomes using this quantitative severity grading system provides uniquely informative representations of relative burdens of morbidities.},

  abstract = {Model selection is a topic of special relevance in molecular phylogenetics that affects many, if not all, stages of phylogenetic inference. Here we discuss some fundamental concepts and techniques of model selection in the context of phylogenetics. We start by reviewing different aspects of the selection of substitution models in phylogenetics from a theoretical, philosophical and practical point of view, and summarize this comparison in table format. We argue that the most commonly implemented model selection approach, the hierarchical likelihood ratio test, is not the optimal strategy for model selection in phylogenetics, and that approaches like the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian methods offer important advantages. In particular, the latter two methods are able to simultaneously compare multiple nested or nonnested models, assess model selection uncertainty, and allow for the estimation of phylogenies and model parameters using all available models (model-averaged inference or multimodel inference). We also describe how the relative importance of the different parameters included in substitution models can be depicted. To illustrate some of these points, we have applied AIC-based model averaging to 37 mitochondrial DNA sequences from the subgenus Ohomopterus (genus Carabus) ground beetles described by Sota and Vogler (2001).},

  abstract = {BackgroundThe provision of safe and timely surgical care is essential to global health care. Low- and middle-income countries have a disproportionate share of the global surgical disease burden and struggle to provide care with the given resources. Surgery cancellation worldwide occurs for many reasons, which are likely to differ between high-income and low-income settings. We sought to evaluate the proportion of elective surgery that is cancelled and the associated reasons for cancellation at a tertiary hospital in Malawi.MethodsThis was a retrospective review of a database maintained by the Department of Anesthesiology at Kamuzu Central Hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi. Data were available from August 2011 to January 2015 and included weekday records for the number of scheduled surgeries, the number of cancelled surgeries, and the reasons for cancellation. Descriptive statistics were performed.ResultsOf 10,730 scheduled surgeries, 4740 (44.2\%) were cancelled. The most common reason for cancellation was infrastructural limitations (84.8\%), including equipment shortages (50.9\%) and time constraints (33.3\%). Provider limitations accounted for 16.5\% of cancellations, most often due to shortages of anaesthesia providers. Preoperative medical conditions contributed to 26.3\% of cancellations.ConclusionThis study demonstrates a high case cancellation rate at a tertiary hospital in Malawi, attributable primarily to infrastructural limitations. These data provide evidence that investments in medical infrastructure and prevention of workforce brain drain are critical to surgical services in this region.},

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a preoperative risk stratification tool to predict 30-day mortality after non-cardiac surgery in adults by analysis of data from the observational National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD) Knowing the Risk study. Methods The data set was split into derivation and validation cohorts. Logistic regression was used to construct a model in the derivation cohort to create the Surgical Outcome Risk Tool (SORT), which was tested in the validation cohort. Results Prospective data for 19\,097 cases in 326 hospitals were obtained from the NCEPOD study. Following exclusion of 2309, details of 16\,788 patients were analysed (derivation cohort 11\,219, validation cohort 5569). A model of 45 risk factors was refined on repeated regression analyses to develop a model comprising six variables: American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS) grade, urgency of surgery (expedited, urgent, immediate), high-risk surgical specialty (gastrointestinal, thoracic, vascular), surgical severity (from minor to complex major), cancer and age 65\,years or over. In the validation cohort, the SORT was well calibrated and demonstrated better discrimination than the ASA-PS and Surgical Risk Scale; areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were 0{$\cdot$}91 (95 per cent c.i. 0{$\cdot$}88 to 0{$\cdot$}94), 0{$\cdot$}87 (0{$\cdot$}84 to 0{$\cdot$}91) and 0{$\cdot$}88 (0{$\cdot$}84 to 0{$\cdot$}92) respectively (P\,{$<$}\,0{$\cdot$}001).

  abstract = {Background There is a need for an accurate measure of surgical outcomes so that hospitals and surgeons can be compared properly regardless of case mix. POSSUM (Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality and morbidity) uses a physiological score and an operative severity score to calculate risks of mortality and morbidity. In a previous small study it was found that Portsmouth POSSUM (P-POSSUM; a modification of the POSSUM system) provided a more accurate prediction of mortality. Methods Some 10 000 general surgical interventions (excluding paediatric and day cases) were studied prospectively between August 1993 and November 1995. The POSSUM mortality equation was applied to the full 10 000 surgical episodes. The 10 000 patients were arranged in chronological order and the first 2500 were used as a training set to produce the modified P-POSSUM predictor equation. This was then applied prospectively to the remaining 7500 patients arranged chronologically in five groups of 1500. Results The original POSSUM logistic regression equation for mortality overpredicts the overall risk of death by more than twofold and the risk of death for patients at lowest risk (5 per cent or less) by more than sevenfold. The P-POSSUM equation produced a very close fit with the observed in-hospital mortality.

A targeted referral system was used by trained nurses to direct referrals to a supervising consultant anaesthetist or to the surgical team. Of 2726 patients pre-assessed in the first 2~years, 105 patients (3.9\%) were cancelled or postponed for medical optimisation after pre-assessment. There were 137 cancellations (5.0\%) on the day of surgery, despite pre-assessment, but only 36 were for anaesthetic or medical reasons. Only eight of these 36 were considered a `failure' of the pre-assessment system. These results are much better than the cancellation rate of about 11\% in the Trust as a whole. There were 18 transfers of patients postoperatively from the elective centre to another hospital. A review suggested that four of these transfers could have been reasonably predictable from the patients' medical history. We conclude that a pre-assessment clinic has an important role to play in minimizing cancellations on the day of surgery and also in reducing the number of patients transferred to other hospitals. This last conclusion has an important implication for the planning of systems in hospitals that perform only elective surgery.},

  abstract = {Background Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is an exercise stress test with concomitant expired gas analysis that provides an objective, non-invasive measure of functional capacity under stress. CPET-derived variables predict postoperative morbidity and mortality after major abdominal and thoracic surgery. Two previous surveys have reported increasing utilisation of CPET preoperatively in England. We aimed to evaluate current CPET practice in the UK, to identify who performs CPET, how it is performed, how the data generated are used and the funding models. Methods All anaesthetic departments in trusts with adult elective surgery in the UK were contacted by telephone to obtain contacts for their pre-assessment and CPET service leads. An online survey was sent to all leads between November 2016 and March 2017. Results The response rate to the online survey was 73.1\% (144/197) with 68.1\% (98/144) reporting an established clinical service and 3.5\% (5/144) setting up a service. Approximately 30,000 tests are performed a year with 93.0\% (80/86) using cycle ergometry. Colorectal surgical patients are the most frequently tested (89.5\%, 77/86). The majority of tests are performed and interpreted by anaesthetists. There is variability in the methods of interpretation and reporting of CPET and limited external validation of results. Conclusions This survey has identified the continued expansion of perioperative CPET services in the UK which have doubled since 2011. The vast majority of CPET tests are performed and reported by anaesthetists. It has highlighted variation in practice and a lack of standardised reporting implying a need for practice guidelines and standardised training to ensure high-quality data to inform perioperative decision making.},

  abstract = {PurposeTo quantify the numbers of critical care beds in Europe and to understand the differences in these numbers between countries when corrected for population size and gross domestic product.MethodsProspective data collection of critical care bed numbers for each country in Europe from July 2010 to July 2011. Sources were identified in each country that could provide data on numbers of critical care beds (intensive care and intermediate care). These data were then cross-referenced with data from international databases describing population size and age, gross domestic product (GDP), expenditure on healthcare and numbers of acute care beds.ResultsWe identified 2,068,892 acute care beds and 73,585 (2.8 \%) critical care beds. Due to the heterogeneous descriptions of these beds in the individual countries it was not possible to discriminate between intensive care and intermediate care in most cases. On average there were 11.5 critical care beds per 100,000 head of population, with marked differences between countries (Germany 29.2, Portugal 4.2). The numbers of critical care beds per country corrected for population size were positively correlated with GDP (r2 = 0.16, p = 0.05), numbers of acute care beds corrected for population (r2 = 0.12, p = 0.05) and the percentage of acute care beds designated as critical care (r2 = 0.59, p {$<$} 0.0001). They were not correlated with the proportion of GDP expended on healthcare.ConclusionsCritical care bed numbers vary considerably between countries in Europe. Better understanding of these numbers should facilitate improved planning for critical care capacity and utilization in the future.},

We developed a cost-effectiveness model using secondary data sources to estimate the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year gained of treatment in intensive care vs non-intensive care treatment in adults. Estimates of hospital mortality with and without intensive care were obtained from seven published studies and from data published by the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre. Quality of life estimates were obtained from a literature review and NHS reference costs were used. Relative to nonintensive care treatment, the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year gained of treatment in intensive care is \textsterling 7010. This figure is sensitive to the mortality risk reduction associated with intensive care. Despite the high daily cost of intensive care, its cost-effectiveness is excellent and compares favourably with other commonly used health interventions. Our findings suggest that adult intensive care represents good value for money.},

Of the remaining 1,332 patients, 1,139 were admitted, and 193 were denied admission because the unit was full (65 were never admitted, 39 were admitted after bumping of another patient, and 89 were admitted on subsequent referral). Crude Day 28 and Day 60 mortality rates in the nonadmitted and admitted groups were 30.1 versus 24.3\% (P = 0.07) and 33.3 versus 27.2\% (P = 0.06), respectively. Day 28 mortality adjusted on age, previous disease, Glasgow scale score less than or equal to 8, shock, creatinine level greater than or equal to 250 {$\mu$}mol/L, and prothrombin time greater than or equal to 30 seconds was nonsignificantly higher in patients refused ICU admission only because of a full unit compared with patients admitted immediately. Patients admitted after subsequent referral had higher mortality rates on Day 28 (P = 0.05) and Day 60 (P = 0.04) compared with directly admitted patients.Conclusions: Delayed ICU admission due to a full unit at first referral is associated with increased mortality.},

If exposure to a necessary agent is homogeneous within a population, then case/control and cohort methods will fail to detect it: they will only identify markers of susceptibility. The corresponding strategies in control are the `high-risk' approach, which seeks to protect susceptible individuals, and the population approach, which seeks to control the causes of incidence. The two approaches are not usually in competition, but the prior concern should always be to discover and control the causes of incidence.},

This review summarizes current evidence on how information from the preoperative, operative, and immediate postoperative periods can help identify such individuals. Recent findings Simple risk indices, such as the Revised Cardiac Risk Index or American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status scale, and online calculators allow risk to be estimated with moderate accuracy using readily available preoperative clinical information. Both specific specialized tests (i.e., cardiopulmonary exercise testing and cardiac stress testing) and promising novel biomarkers (i.e., troponins and natriuretic peptides) can help refine these risk estimates before surgery. Estimates of perioperative risk can be further informed by information acquired during the operative and immediate postoperative periods, such as risk indices (i.e., surgical Apgar score), individual risk factors (i.e., intraoperative hypotension), or postoperative biomarkers (i.e., troponins and natriuretic peptides). Summary Preoperative clinical risk indices and risk calculators estimate surgical risk with moderate accuracy. Although novel biomarkers, specialized preoperative testing, and immediate postoperative risk indices show promise as methods to refine these risk estimates, more research is needed on how best to integrate risk information from these different sources.},

Whether these benefits also affect survival of critically ill patients with secondary peritonitis is unclear as is the relevance of specific prognostic factors, such as source control. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of data collected prospectively from March 1993 to February 2005. A cohort of 319 consecutive postoperative patients with secondary peritonitis requiring intensive care was evaluated. End points for outcome analysis were derived from daily changes of hazard rate. Results Four-month survival rate after intensive care unit (ICU) admission was 31.7\%. For patients who have survived for more than 4 months, the 1-year survival was 82.7\%. After adjustment for relevant covariates, a high disease severity at ICU admission and during ICU stay, specific comorbidities (extended malignancies, liver cirrhosis) and sources of infection (distal esophagus, stomach), and an inadequate initial antibiotic therapy were associated with worse 4-month prognosis. Inability to obtain source control was the most important determinant of mortality, and treatment after 2002 was combined with improved prognosis. Conclusions Four-month prognosis of critically ill, surgical patients with secondary peritonitis is poor and mostly determined by the ability to obtain source control. Outcome has improved since 2002, and after successful surgical and intensive care therapy long-term survival seems to be good.},

  abstract = {Study objectives To assess the impact of a new postanesthesia care unit (PACU) on intensive care unit (ICU) utilization, hospital length of stay, and complications following major noncardiac surgery. Design Observational study. Setting University hospital. Patients and measurements From 1992 to 1999, 915 patients underwent either abdominal aortic reconstruction (n = 448) or lung resection for cancer (n = 467). Demographic, clinical, surgical, and anesthetic data, as well as perioperative complications, were abstracted from two institutional databases. Interventions Patients were divided in two study periods, before and after the opening of a new PACU (period 1992\textendash 1995 and period 1996\textendash 1999). Main results Utilization of ICU decreased from 35\% to 16\% for vascular patients and from 57\% to less than 4\% for thoracic patients during the second period. Readmission to the ICU, perioperative mortality, and respiratory complications were comparable between the two periods. Patients with congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or renal insufficiency were more likely to be admitted to the ICU than the PACU. Following vascular surgery the frequency of cardiac complications decreased from 10.6\% in 1992\textendash 1995 to 5.2\% in 1996\textendash 1999 (p {$<$} 0.005), as well as the need for postoperative mechanical ventilation (25\% vs. 12\%; P {$<$} 0.05). Conclusions Increased availability of PACU beds resulted in reduced utilization of ICU resources without compromising patient care after major noncardiac surgery.},

  abstract = {Background The 6-min walk test (6MWT) is a common means of functional assessment. Its relationship to disability-free survival (DFS) is uncertain. Methods This sub-study of the Measurement of Exercise Tolerance for Surgery study had co-primary outcome measures: correlation of the preoperative 6MWT distance with 30 day quality of recovery (15-item quality of recovery) and 12 month WHO Disability Assessment Schedule scores. The prognostic utility of the 6MWT and other risk assessment tools for 12 month DFS was assessed with logistic regression and receiver-operating-characteristic-curve analysis. Results Of 574 patients recruited, 567 (99\%) completed the 6MWT. Twelve months after surgery, 16 (2.9\%) patients had died and 444 (77\%) had DFS. The 6MWT correlated weakly with 30 day 15-item quality of recovery ({$\rho$}=0.14; P=0.001) and 12 month WHO Disability Assessment Schedule ({$\rho$}=\textendash 0.23; P{$<$}0.0005) scores. When the cohort was split into 6MWT distance tertiles, the adjusted odds ratio of low vs high tertiles for DFS was 3.13 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.54\textendash 6.35]. The only independent variable predictive of DFS was the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) score (adjusted odds ratio: 1.06; P{$<$}0.0005). The area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve for DFS was 0.63 (95\% CI: 0.57\textendash 0.70) for the 6MWT, 0.60 (95\% CI: 0.53\textendash 0.67) for cardiopulmonary-exercise-testing-derived peak oxygen consumption, and 0.70 (95\% CI: 0.64\textendash 0.76) for the DASI score. Conclusions Of the risk assessment tools analysed, the DASI was the most predictive of DFS. The 6MWT was safe and comparable with cardiopulmonary exercise testing for all predictive assessments. Future research should aim to determine the optimal 6MWT distance thresholds for risk prediction.},

  abstract = {Objective: A lack of intensive care units beds in Israel results in critically ill patients being treated outside of the intensive care unit. The survival of such patients is largely unknown. The present study's objective was to screen entire hospitals for newly deteriorated patients and compare their survival in and out of the intensive care unit., Design: A priori developed intensive care unit admission criteria were used to screen, during 2 wks, the patient population for eligible incident patients. A screening team visited every hospital ward of five acute care hospitals daily. Eligible patients were identified among new admissions in the emergency department and among hospitalized patients who acutely deteriorated. Patients were followed for 30 days for mortality regardless of discharge., Setting: Five acute care hospitals., Patients: A total of 749 newly deteriorated patients., Interventions: None., Measurements and Main Results: Crude survival of patients in and out of the intensive care unit was compared by Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox models were constructed to adjust the survival comparisons for residual case-mix differences. A total of 749 newly deteriorated patients were identified among 44,000 patients screened (1.7\%). Of these, 13\% were admitted to intensive care unit, 32\% to special care units, and 55\% to regular departments. Intensive care unit patients had better early survival (0-3 days) relative to regular departments (p = .0001) in a Cox multivariate model. Early advantage of intensive care was most pronounced among patients who acutely deteriorated while on hospital wards rather than among newly admitted patients., Conclusions: Only a small proportion of eligible patients reach the intensive care unit, and early admission is imperative for their survival advantage. As intensive care unit benefit was most pronounced among those deteriorating on hospital wards, intensive care unit triage decisions should be targeted at maximizing intensive care unit benefit by early admitting patients deteriorating on hospital wards., (C) 2007 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins},

  abstract = {High-risk, noncardiac surgery represents only 12.5\% of surgical procedures, but 83.3\% of deaths. The postanaesthetic care unit (PACU) addresses the need for an improved level of care for these patients by providing postoperative high-dependency or intensive care (Level 2 or 3). The PACU aims to improve the structure of care provision for high-risk surgical patients. By maintaining 24-hour cover at the same staffing level, the risk of poorer `out-of- hours' care is reduced. In a PACU, whose remit is solely postoperative care, evidence-based protocols can be established to standardize the care given. The aim is to provide 24~hours of postoperative optimized care, thus targeting the period when these patients are most vulnerable, to reduce the risk of complications developing and identify complications promptly, should they occur. The PACU is set up to facilitate certain processes to aid optimized care in the postoperative period. These include invasive and noninvasive ventilation, goal-directed haemodynamic management, invasive monitoring and optimal pain management. Identification of high-risk patients who might benefit from PACU care is not always straightforward. However, tools are available to aid the clinician, supplementing clinical assessment and basic investigations. These include clinical prediction rules and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Both the setting up and the running of a PACU clearly have cost implications. However, the reduction in postoperative morbidity, and thus patients' length of stay, should, overall, reduce costs. The benefits of a PACU should therefore be seen in terms of improved surgical outcomes, reducing postoperative morbidity and mortality, and cost savings.},

  abstract = {\&lt;h3\&gt;Importance\&lt;/h3\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;For more than 2 decades, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has relied on risk-adjusted, postoperative, 30-day mortality data as a measure of surgical quality of care. Recently, the use of 30-day mortality data has been criticized based on a theory that health care professionals manage patient care to meet the metric and that other outcome metrics are available.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;h3\&gt;Objectives\&lt;/h3\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;To determine whether postoperative mortality data identify a delay in care to meet a 30-day mortality metric and to evaluate whether 30-day mortality risk score groups stratify survival patterns up to 365 days after surgery in surgical procedures assessed by the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP).\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;h3\&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants\&lt;/h3\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;Patients undergoing VASQIP-assessed surgical procedures within the VHA from October 1, 2011, to September 30, 2013, were evaluated.

The mean probability of death was 1.03\% (95\% CI, 1.01\%-1.04\%). Risk estimate groups in the 212 733 surgical cases analyzed showed significantly different postoperative survival, with consistency beyond the time frame for which they were developed. The lowest risk decile had the highest 365-day survival probability (99.74\%; 95\% CI, 99.66\%-99.80\%); the highest risk decile had the lowest 365-day survival probability (72.04\%; 95\% CI, 71.43\%-72.64\%). The 9 lowest risk deciles had linear survival curves from 0 to 365 postoperative days, with the highest risk decile having early survival risk and becoming more linear after the first 180 days. Survival curves between 25 and 35 days were consistent for all risk deciles and showed no evidence that mortality rates were affected in the immediate period beyond day 30. The setting of mortality varied by postoperative day ranges, with index hospitalization events declining and deaths outside of the hospital increasing up to 365 days.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;h3\&gt;Conclusions and Relevance\&lt;/h3\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;Deciles of 30-day mortality estimates are associated with significantly different survival outcomes at 365 days even after removing patients who died within the first 30 postoperative days. No evidence of delays in patient care and treatment to meet a 30-day metric were identified. These findings reinforce the usefulness of 30-day mortality risk stratification as a surrogate for long-term outcomes.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding intensive care unit (ICU) triage decisions for high-risk surgical patients may ultimately facilitate resource allocation and improve outcomes. The surgical Apgar score (SAS) is a simple score that uses intraoperative information on hemodynamics and blood loss to predict postoperative morbidity and mortality, with lower scores associated with worse outcomes. We hypothesized that the SAS would be associated with the decision to admit a patient to the ICU postoperatively. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of adults undergoing major intraabdominal surgery from 2003 to 2010 at an academic medical center. We calculated the SAS (0-10) for each patient based on intraoperative heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, and estimated blood loss. Using logistic regression, we assessed the association of the SAS with the decision to admit a patient directly to the ICU after surgery. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 8501 patients, with 72.7\% having an SAS of 7 to 10 and {$<$}5\% an SAS of 0 to 4. A total of 8.7\% of patients were transferred immediately to the ICU postoperatively. After multivariate adjustment, there was a strong association between the SAS and the decision to admit a patient to the ICU (adjusted odds ratio 14.41 [95\% confidence interval \{CI\}, 6.88-30.19, P {$<$} 0.001] for SAS 0-2, 4.42 [95\% CI, 3.19-6.13, P {$<$} 0.001] for SAS 3-4, and 2.60 [95\% CI, 2.08-3.24, P {$<$} 0.001] for SAS 5-6 compared with SAS 7-8). CONCLUSIONS: The SAS is strongly associated with clinical decisions regarding immediate ICU admission after high-risk intraabdominal surgery. These results provide an initial step toward understanding whether intraoperative hemodynamics and blood loss influence ICU triage for postsurgical patients.},

  abstract = {ContextHypoxemia complicates the recovery of 30\% to 50\% of patients after abdominal surgery; endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required in 8\% to 10\% of cases, increasing morbidity and mortality and prolonging intensive care unit and hospital stay.ObjectiveTo determine the effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure compared with standard treatment in preventing the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation in patients who develop acute hypoxemia after elective major abdominal surgery.Design and SettingRandomized, controlled, unblinded study with concealed allocation conducted between June 2002 and November 2003 at 15 intensive care units of the Piedmont Intensive Care Units Network in Italy.PatientsConsecutive patients who developed severe hypoxemia after major elective abdominal surgery. The trial was stopped for efficacy after 209 patients had been enrolled.InterventionsPatients were randomly assigned to receive oxygen (n = 104) or oxygen plus continuous positive airway pressure (n = 105).Main Outcome MeasuresThe primary end point was incidence of endotracheal intubation; secondary end points were intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay, incidence of pneumonia, infection and sepsis, and hospital mortality.ResultsPatients who received oxygen plus continuous positive airway pressure had a lower intubation rate (1\% vs 10\%; P = .005; relative risk [RR], 0.099; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.01-0.76) and had a lower occurrence rate of pneumonia (2\% vs 10\%, RR, 0.19; 95\% CI, 0.04-0.88; P = .02), infection (3\% vs 10\%, RR, 0.27; 95\% CI, 0.07-0.94; P = .03), and sepsis (2\% vs 9\%; RR, 0.22; 95\% CI, 0.04-0.99; P = .03) than did patients treated with oxygen alone. Patients who received oxygen plus continuous positive airway pressure also spent fewer mean (SD) days in the intensive care unit (1.4 [1.6] vs 2.6 [4.2], P = .09) than patients treated with oxygen alone. The treatments did not affect the mean (SD) days that patients spent in the hospital (15 [13] vs 17 [15], respectively; P = .10). None of those treated with oxygen plus continuous positive airway pressure died in the hospital while 3 deaths occurred among those treated with oxygen alone (P = .12).ConclusionContinuous positive airway pressure may decrease the incidence of endotracheal intubation and other severe complications in patients who develop hypoxemia after elective major abdominal surgery.},

  abstract = {Logistic regression analysis may well be used to develop a predictive model for a dichotomous medical outcome, such as short-term mortality. When the data set is small compared to the number of covariables studied, shrinkage techniques may improve predictions. We compared the performance of three variants of shrinkage techniques: 1) a linear shrinkage factor, which shrinks all coefficients with the same factor; 2) penalized maximum likelihood (or ridge regression), where a penalty factor is added to the likelihood function such that coefficients are shrunk individually according to the variance of each covariable; 3) the Lasso, which shrinks some coefficients to zero by setting a constraint on the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of standardized covariables. Logistic regression models were constructed to predict 30-day mortality after acute myocardial infarction. Small data sets were created from a large randomized controlled trial, half of which provided independent validation data. We found that all three shrinkage techniques improved the calibration of predictions compared to the standard maximum likelihood estimates. This study illustrates that shrinkage is a valuable tool to overcome some of the problems of overfitting in medical data.},

  abstract = {The performance of prediction models can be assessed using a variety of different methods and metrics. Traditional measures for binary and survival outcomes include the Brier score to indicate overall model performance, the concordance (or c) statistic for discriminative ability (or area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve), and goodness-of-fit statistics for calibration., Several new measures have recently been proposed that can be seen as refinements of discrimination measures, including variants of the c statistic for survival, reclassification tables, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Moreover, decision\textendash analytic measures have been proposed, including decision curves to plot the net benefit achieved by making decisions based on model predictions., We aimed to define the role of these relatively novel approaches in the evaluation of the performance of prediction models. For illustration we present a case study of predicting the presence of residual tumor versus benign tissue in patients with testicular cancer (n=544 for model development, n=273 for external validation)., We suggest that reporting discrimination and calibration will always be important for a prediction model. Decision-analytic measures should be reported if the predictive model is to be used for making clinical decisions. Other measures of performance may be warranted in specific applications, such as reclassification metrics to gain insight into the value of adding a novel predictor to an established model.},

  abstract = {Background Postoperative complications are key outcomes of surgical procedures, but currently there is no uniform quantitative measure of complication severity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and establish feasibility of quantitative morbidity scores for several common abdominal surgical procedures. Study Design Using American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data, complications were identified in 5 common abdominal procedures for one institution in 2005-2008, including inguinal hernia, appendectomy, laparoscopic colectomy, hepatectomy, and pancreaticoduodenectomy. Complications were graded by the 6-level ``expanded'' Accordion Severity Grading System. Quantification was performed using severity scores described previously. Results Six hundred and seventy-six procedures were identified, including 88 patients (13.84\%) who had complications and 5 patients (0.79\%) who died. After severity weighting, the postoperative morbidity index (PMI) for each procedure was derived. An index of 0 would indicate no complication in any patient and an index of 1.000 would indicate that all operated patients died. PMIs were hernia repair 0.005; appendectomy 0.031; laparoscopic colectomy 0.082; hepatectomy 0.145; and pancreaticoduodenectomy 0.150. PMI of hepatectomy was greatly affected by the presence of a second procedure, ie, 0.070 without a second procedure and 0.427 with a second procedure. Weighted severity spectragrams were developed, portraying the impact of each grade of complication on overall morbidity. Conclusions Quantification of severity of postoperative complications is possible using American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program methods and the Accordion Severity Grading System. Procedural PMI can be useful in assessing surgical outcomes. Certain limitations, particularly the need for risk adjustment, still need to be addressed.},

  abstract = {Although the randomised controlled trial is the ``gold standard'' for studying the efficacy and safety of medical treatments, it is not necessarily free from bias. When patients do not follow the protocol for their assigned treatment, the resultant ``treatment contamination'' can produce misleading findings. The methods used historically to deal with this problem, the ``as treated'' and ``per protocol'' analysis techniques, are flawed and inaccurate. Intention to treat analysis is the solution most often used to analyse randomised controlled trials, but this approach ignores this issue of treatment contamination. Intention to treat analysis estimates the effect of recommending a treatment to study participants, not the effect of the treatment on those study participants who actually received it. In this article, we describe a simple yet rarely used analytical technique, the ``contamination adjusted intention to treat analysis,'' which complements the intention to treat approach by producing a better estimate of the benefits and harms of receiving a treatment. This method uses the statistical technique of instrumental variable analysis to address contamination. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the current methods of addressing treatment contamination and the contamination adjusted intention to treat technique, provide examples of effective uses, and discuss how using estimates generated by contamination adjusted intention to treat analysis can improve clinical decision making and patient care.},

  abstract = {Background: Comparative surgical audit is becoming increasingly important although it is fraught with difficulties due to risk-adjusted analysis. Methods have been proposed to solve this problem and allow meaningful comparison of patient outcome. None has been described without faults, making such comparison flawed or overtly complicated. An alternative risk scoring system incorporating the Confidential Enquiry into Perioperative Deaths (CEPOD) grade, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade and the British United Provident Association (BUPA) operative grade was formulated and assessed. Methods: This was a prospective audit of 4308 patients admitted under the care of three surgeons between May 1997 and October 1999, creating an initial data set of 3144 procedures with 134 deaths. Each procedure was allocated a score on the basis of the CEPOD, BUPA and ASA grade. The Surgical Risk Scale (SRS) was devised by adding together the values of the three variables, which generated a scale ranging from 3 to 14. Multivariate logistic regression analysis involving the three variables and univariate analysis of the SRS score were undertaken. Receiver\textendash operator characteristic and calibration curves were formulated. This process was validated on another data set (2780 patients) derived from all admissions to the same surgeons between November 1999 and December 2000. Results: Univariate logistic analysis of the SRS score revealed it to be significantly predictive of death ({$\beta$} = 0{$\cdot$}84, P \&lt; 0{$\cdot$}001); it did not overpredict mortality for low-risk procedures. Conclusion: The SRS is easy to use, formulate and interpret, and provides an accurate prediction of death in general surgical patients across the entire risk spectrum. \textcopyright{} 2002 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd},

Representative values of this measure are reported here for systems in medical imaging, materials testing, weather forecasting, information retrieval, polygraph lie detection, and aptitude testing. Though the measure itself is sound, the values obtained from tests of diagnostic systems often require qualification because the test data on which they are based are of unsure quality. A common set of problems in testing is faced in all fields. How well these problems are handled, or can be handled in a given field, determines the degree of confidence that can be placed in a measured value of accuracy.

The aim of this study was to quantify and explore variability in mortality amongst high-risk emergency general surgery admissions to English NHS hospital Trusts. Methods The Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database was used to identify high-risk emergency general surgery diagnoses (greater than 5 per cent national 30-day mortality rate). Adults admitted to English NHS Trusts with these diagnoses between 2000 and 2009 were included in the study. Thirty-day in-hospital mortality was adjusted for patient and hospital factors. Trusts were grouped into high- and low-mortality outliers, and resource availability was compared between high- and low-mortality outlier institutions. Results Some 367 796 patients admitted to 145 hospital Trusts were included in the study; the 30-day mortality rate was 15{$\cdot$}6 per cent (institutional range 9{$\cdot$}2\textendash 18{$\cdot$}2 per cent). Fourteen and 24 hospital Trusts were identified as high- and low-mortality outlier institutions respectively. Intensive care and high-dependency bed resources, as well as greater institutional use of computed tomography (CT), were independent predictors of reduced mortality (P {$<$} 0{$\cdot$}001). Low-mortality outlying Trusts had significantly more intensive care beds per 1000 hospital beds (20{$\cdot$}8 versus 14{$\cdot$}0; P = 0{$\cdot$}017) and made significantly greater use of CT (24{$\cdot$}6 versus 17{$\cdot$}2 scans per bed per year; P {$<$} 0{$\cdot$}001) and ultrasonography (42{$\cdot$}5 versus 30{$\cdot$}2 scans per bed per year; P {$<$} 0{$\cdot$}001). Conclusion There is significant variability in mortality risk between hospital Trusts treating high-risk emergency general surgery patients.

Design: Questionnaire survey. Setting: Outpatient surgery unit of a large university children's hospital. Participants: 127 parents of children whose elective outpatient surgery had been cancelled. Interventions: A total of 200 questionnaires were mailed to the parents of children who had their outpatient surgery cancelled. Measurements and Main Results: Of those children whose surgery had been cancelled, 34.6\% were due to upper respiratory infections (URIs), 30.7\% for other medical reasons, and the balance for scheduling errors, because the child had not fasted, or for difficulties with transportation. The majority of surgeries (58.3\%) were cancelled prior to their scheduled surgery date. However, 18.9\% were cancelled on the day of surgery prior to leaving for the hospital and 22.8\% were cancelled on arrival at the outpatient surgery clinic. Of those patients whose surgeries were not cancelled until they arrived at the hospital, 38.5\% of mothers and 50.0\% of fathers missed a day of work and, of these, 53.3\% and 42.1\%, respectively, went unpaid for the work day missed. The mean number of miles driven (round trip) to the hospital for a cancelled operation was 158.8 miles (range 8 to 1,350 miles). Additional testing and new appointments were ordered in 25.2\% of the cancelled cases. 45\% of parents and 16\% of children were disappointed by the cancellation; 16\% of parents were frustrated by the cancellation and 3.3\% were angry. Conclusions: This study suggests that last-minute cancellation of surgery has an important impact on patients and their families and suggests a need to review present protocols for screening patients prior to surgery.},

Methods A retrospective cost analysis of ICU patients was performed from the hospital's perspective. The standardized costing methodology was developed on the basis of the availability of data at the seven ICU departments. It entailed the application of the bottom\textendash up approach for ``hotel and nutrition'' and the top\textendash down approach for ``diagnostics,'' ``consumables,'' and ``labor.'' Results Direct costs per ICU day ranged from \texteuro 1168 to \texteuro 2025. Even though the distribution of costs varied by cost component, labor was the most important cost driver at all departments. The costs for ``labor'' amounted to \texteuro 1629 at department G but were fairly similar at the other departments (\texteuro 711 {$\pm$} 115). Conclusions Direct costs of ICU days vary widely between the seven departments. Our standardized costing methodology could serve as a valuable instrument to compare actual cost differences, such as those resulting from differences in patient case-mix.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:~In this prespecified cohort study, we investigated the influence of postoperative admission to the intensive care unit versus surgical ward on health care utilization among patients undergoing intermediate-risk surgery.         METHODS:~Of adult surgical patients who underwent general anesthesia without an absolute indication for postoperative intensive care unit admission, 3530 patients admitted postoperatively to an intensive care unit were matched to 3530 patients admitted postoperatively to a surgical ward using a propensity score based on 23 important preoperative and intraoperative predictor variables. Postoperative hospital length of stay and hospital costs were defined as primary and secondary end points, respectively.         RESULTS:~Among patients with low propensity for postoperative intensive care unit admission, initial triage to an intensive care unit was associated with increased postoperative length of stay (incidence rate ratio, 1.69 [95\% CI, 1.59\textendash 1.79]; P {$<$} .001) and hospital costs (incidence rate ratio, 1.92 [95\% CI, 1.81\textendash 2.03]; P {$<$} .001). By contrast, postoperative intensive care unit admission of patients with high propensity was associated with decreased postoperative length of stay (incidence rate ratio, 0.90 [95\% CI, 0.85\textendash 0.95]; P {$<$} .001) and costs (incidence rate ratio, 0.92 [95\% CI, 0.88\textendash 0.97]; P = .001). Decisions regarding postoperative intensive care unit resource utilization were influenced by individual preferences of anesthesiologists and surgeons.         CONCLUSIONS:~In patients with an unclear indication for postoperative critical care, intensive care unit admission may negatively impact postoperative hospital length of stay and costs. Postoperative discharge disposition varies substantially based on anesthesia and surgical provider preferences but should optimally be driven by an objective assessment of a patient's status at the end of surgery.},

The new acute care surgery training paradigm (including trauma, surgical critical care, and emergency general surgery) has been developed to increase interest in trauma and surgical critical care, but the number of interested trainees remains too few. Recommendations are made for broadening the multidisciplinary training and practice opportunities in surgical critical care for intensivists from all base specialties and for maintaining the intensivist model within acute care surgery practice. Support from academic and administrative leadership, as well as national organizations, will be needed.},

Methods: Data on 5051 consecutive patients (isolated [74.4\%] or combined coronary artery bypass grafting [11.1\%], valve surgery [12.0\%] and thoracic aortic surgery [2.5\%]) were prospectively collected. The EuroSCORE model (standard and logistic) was used to predict in-hospital mortality, 3-month mortality, prolonged length of stay ({$\gg$}12 days) and major postoperative complications (intraoperative stroke, stroke over 24h, postoperative myocardial infarction, deep sternal wound infection, re-exploration for bleeding, sepsis and/or endocarditis, gastrointestinal complications, postoperative renal failure and respiratory failure). A C statistic (or the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) was used to test the discrimination of the EuroSCORE. The calibration of the model was assessed by the Hosmer\textendash Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic. Results: In-hospital mortality was 3.9\% and 16.1\% of patients had one or more major complications. Standard EuroSCORE showed very good discriminatory ability and good calibration in predicting in-hospital mortality (C statistic: 0.76, Hosmer\textendash Lemeshow: P=0.449) and postoperative renal failure (C statistic: 0.79, Hosmer\textendash Lemeshow: P=0.089) and good discriminatory ability in predicting sepsis and/or endocarditis (C statistic: 0.74, Hosmer\textendash Lemeshow: P=0.653), 3-month mortality (C statistic: 0.73, Hosmer\textendash Lemeshow: P=0.097), prolonged length of stay (C statistic: 0.71, Hosmer\textendash Lemeshow: P=0.051) and respiratory failure (C statistic: 0.71, Hosmer\textendash Lemeshow: P=0.714). There were no differences in terms of the discriminatory ability in predicting these outcomes between standard and logistic EuroSCORE. However, logistic EuroSCORE showed no calibration (Hosmer\textendash Lemeshow: P{$\ll$}0.05) except for sepsis and/or endocarditis (Hosmer\textendash Lemeshow: P=0.078). EuroSCORE was unable to predict other major complications such as intraoperative stroke, stroke over 24h, postoperative myocardial infarction, deep sternal wound infection, gastrointestinal complications and re-exploration for bleeding. Conclusions: EuroSCORE can be used to predict not only in-hospital mortality, for which it was originally designed, but also 3-month mortality, prolonged length of stay and specific postoperative complications such as renal failure, sepsis and/or endocarditis and respiratory failure in the whole context of cardiac surgery. These outcomes can be predicted accurately using the standard EuroSCORE which is very simple and easy in its calculation.},

Several features of this problem are common in healthcare. Every healthcare system around the world has to balance the pressure for high utilisation of an expensive or scarce resource with the pressure for that resource to be available on demand for patients who need it. In the absence of variability, this would be a simple task of matching supply to a steady level of demand. Variability in timing and nature of referrals and in length of stay complicates matters. Striking the balance between utilisation and access is a daily challenge for clinicians. Starting with about the right level of capacity in place can help. Operational Research (OR), the use of mathematical and computer based modelling to address complex problems of this nature, has great potential for informing capacity planning exercises within health services.2 There are many academic groups and OR practitioners active in the UK (see for instance mashnet.info) and internationally able to provide advice and conduct modelling studies in this area. A crucial role OR modelling serves is to allow decision makers to explore the trade-offs that exist between what seems efficient from the perspective of patients and what seems efficient from the perspective of managers. If you engage with Operational Researchers, you will find them to be a bit geeky (though usually in a nice way) and you \ldots},

Methods A discrete?choice experiment was conducted, using paper and electronic surveys. Participants comprised: former and current patients (at any stage of treatment) with prostate, bladder, kidney or oesophagogastric cancer who previously participated in the National Cancer Patient Experience Survey; health professionals with experience of cancer care (11 types including surgeons, nurses and oncologists); and members of the public. Choice scenarios were based on the following attributes: travel time to hospital, risk of serious complications, risk of death, annual number of operations at the centre, access to a specialist multidisciplinary team (MDT) and specialist surgeon cover after surgery. Results Responses were obtained from 444 individuals (206 patients, 111 health professionals and 127 members of the public). The response rate was 52{$\cdot$}8 per cent for the patient sample; it was unknown for the other groups as the survey was distributed via multiple overlapping methods. Preferences were particularly influenced by risk of complications, risk of death and access to a specialist MDT. Participants were willing to travel, on average, 75 min longer in order to reduce their risk of complications by 1 per cent, and over 5 h longer to reduce risk of death by 1 per cent. Findings were similar across groups. Conclusion Respondents' preferences in this selected sample were consistent with centralization.},

However, little consensus exists on which prognostic method should be used to adjust ICU LoS for case-mix factors. This study compared the performance of different regression models when predicting ICU LoS. We included data from 32,667 unplanned ICU admissions to ICUs participating in the Dutch National Intensive Care Evaluation (NICE) in the year 2011. We predicted ICU LoS using eight regression models: ordinary least squares regression on untransformed ICU LoS,LoS truncated at 30 days and log-transformed LoS; a generalized linear model with a Gaussian distribution and a logarithmic link function; Poisson regression; negative binomial regression; Gamma regression with a logarithmic link function; and the original and recalibrated APACHE IV model, for all patients together and for survivors and non-survivors separately. We assessed the predictive performance of the models using bootstrapping and the squared Pearson correlation coefficient (R 2 ), root mean squared prediction error (RMSPE), mean absolute prediction error (MAPE) and bias. The distribution of ICU LoS was skewed to the right with a median of 1.7 days (interquartile range 0.8 to 4.0) and a mean of 4.2 days (standard deviation 7.9). The predictive performance of the models was between 0.09 and 0.20 for R 2 , between 7.28 and 8.74 days for RMSPE, between 3.00 and 4.42 days for MAPE and between -2.99 and 1.64 days for bias. The predictive performance was slightly better for survivors than for non-survivors. We were disappointed in the predictive performance of the regression models and conclude that it is difficult to predict LoS of unplanned ICU admissions using patient characteristics at admission time only.},

Effective management of complications and appropriate organization of postoperative care may improve outcome. The importance of the latter is poorly described in emergency GI surgical patients. We aimed to present mortality data and evaluate the postoperative care pathways used after emergency GI surgery. Methods A population-based cohort study with prospectively collected data from six Capital Region hospitals in Denmark. We included 2904 patients undergoing major GI laparotomy or laparoscopy surgery between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2010. The primary outcome measure was 30 day mortality. Results A total of 538 patients [18.5\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 17.1\textendash 19.9] died within 30 days of surgery. In all, 84.2\% of the patients were treated after operation in the standard ward, with a 30 day mortality of 14.3\%, and 4.8\% were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after a median stay of 2 days (inter-quartile range: 1\textendash 6). When compared with `admission to standard ward', `admission to standard ward before ICU admission' and `ICU admission after surgery' were independently associated with 30 day mortality; odds ratio 5.45 (95\% CI: 3.48\textendash 8.56) and 3.27 (95\% CI: 2.45\textendash 4.36), respectively. Conclusions Mortality in emergency major GI surgical patients remains high. Failure to allocate patients to the appropriate level of care immediately after surgery may contribute to the high postoperative mortality. Future research should focus on improving risk stratification and evaluating the effect of different postoperative care pathways in emergency GI surgery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A model was developed for risk adjustment of postoperative mortality in patients with colorectal cancer in order to make fair comparisons between healthcare providers. Previous models were derived in relatively small studies with the use of suboptimal modelling techniques. METHODS: Data from adults included in a national study of major surgery for colorectal cancer were used to develop and validate a logistic regression model for 90-day mortality. The main risk factors were identified from a review of the literature. The association with age was modelled as a curved continuous relationship. Bootstrap resampling was used to select interactions between risk factors. RESULTS: A model based on data from 62\,314 adults was developed that was well calibrated (absolute differences between observed and predicted mortality always smaller than 0{$\cdot$}75 per cent in deciles of predicted risk). It discriminated well between low- and high-risk patients (C-index 0{$\cdot$}800, 95 per cent c.i. 0{$\cdot$}793 to 0{$\cdot$}807). An interaction between age and metastatic disease was included as metastatic disease was found to increase postoperative risk in young patients aged 50 years (odds ratio 3{$\cdot$}53, 95 per cent c.i. 2{$\cdot$}66 to 4{$\cdot$}67) far more than in elderly patients aged 80 years (odds ratio 1{$\cdot$}48, 1{$\cdot$}32 to 1{$\cdot$}66). CONCLUSION: Use of this model, estimated in the largest number of patients with colorectal cancer to date, is recommended when comparing postoperative mortality of major colorectal cancer surgery between hospitals, clinical teams or individual surgeons.},

We looked at whether individual surgeons do sufficient numbers of procedures to be able to reliably identify those with poor performance. For some specialties, the number of procedures that a surgeon does each year is low and, as a result, the chance of identifying a surgeon with increased mortality rates is also low. Therefore, public reporting of individual surgeons' outcomes could lead to false complacency. We recommend use of outcomes that are fairly frequent, considering the hospital as the unit of reporting when numbers are low, and avoiding interpretation of no evidence of poor performance as evidence of acceptable performance.},

  abstract = {Background It was previously estimated that 234{$\cdot$}2 million operations were performed worldwide in 2004. The association between surgical rates and population health outcomes is not clear. We re-estimated global surgical volume to track changes over time and assess rates associated with healthy populations. Methods We gathered demographic, health, and economic data for 194 WHO member states. Surgical volumes were obtained from published studies and other reports from 2005 onwards. We estimated rates of surgery for all countries without available data based on health expenditure in 2012 and assessed the proportion of surgery comprised by caesarean delivery. The rate of surgery was plotted against life expectancy to describe the association between surgical care and this health indicator. Findings We identified 66 countries reporting surgical data between 2005 and 2013. We estimate that 312{$\cdot$}9 million operations (95\% CI 266{$\cdot$}2\textendash 359{$\cdot$}5) took place in 2012\textemdash a 33{$\cdot$}6\% increase over 8 years; the largest proportional increase occurred in countries spending US\$400 or less per capita on health care. Caesarean delivery comprised 29{$\cdot$}8\% (5{$\cdot$}8 million operations) of the total surgical volume in poor health expenditure countries compared with 10{$\cdot$}8\% (7{$\cdot$}8 million operations) in low health expenditure countries and 2{$\cdot$}7\% (5{$\cdot$}1 million operations) in high health expenditure countries. We noted a correlation between increased life expectancy and increased surgical rates up to 1533 operations per 100\hphantom{,}000 people, with significant but less dramatic improvement above this rate. Interpretation Surgical volume is large and continues to grow in all economic environments. A single procedure\textemdash caesarean delivery\textemdash comprised almost a third of surgical volume in the most resource-limited settings. Surgical care is an essential part of health care and is associated with increased life expectancy, yet many low-income countries fail to achieve basic levels of service. Improvements in capacity and delivery of surgical services must be a major component of health system strengthening. Funding None.},

Doctors' clinical subjective assessment of patients' functional capacity has uncertain accuracy. We did a study to compare preoperative subjective assessment with alternative markers of fitness (cardiopulmonary exercise testing [CPET], scores on the Duke Activity Status Index [DASI] questionnaire, and serum N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide [NT pro-BNP] concentrations) for predicting death or complications after major elective non-cardiac surgery. Methods We did a multicentre, international, prospective cohort study at 25 hospitals: five in Canada, seven in the UK, ten in Australia, and three in New Zealand. We recruited adults aged at least 40 years who were scheduled for major non-cardiac surgery and deemed to have one or more risk factors for cardiac complications (eg, a history of heart failure, stroke, or diabetes) or coronary artery disease. Functional capacity was subjectively assessed in units of metabolic equivalents of tasks by the responsible anaesthesiologists in the preoperative assessment clinic, graded as poor (\&lt;4), moderate (4\textendash 10), or good (\&gt;10). All participants also completed the DASI questionnaire, underwent CPET to measure peak oxygen consumption, and had blood tests for measurement of NT pro-BNP concentrations. After surgery, patients had daily electrocardiograms and blood tests to measure troponin and creatinine concentrations until the third postoperative day or hospital discharge. The primary outcome was death or myocardial infarction within 30 days after surgery, assessed in all participants who underwent both CPET and surgery. Prognostic accuracy was assessed using logistic regression, receiver-operating-characteristic curves, and net risk reclassification. Findings Between March 1, 2013, and March 25, 2016, we included 1401 patients in the study. 28 (2\%) of 1401 patients died or had a myocardial infarction within 30 days of surgery. Subjective assessment had 19{$\cdot$}2\% sensitivity (95\% CI 14{$\cdot$}2\textendash 25) and 94{$\cdot$}7\% specificity (93{$\cdot$}2\textendash 95{$\cdot$}9) for identifying the inability to attain four metabolic equivalents during CPET. Only DASI scores were associated with predicting the primary outcome (adjusted odds ratio 0{$\cdot$}96, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}83\textendash 0{$\cdot$}99; p=0{$\cdot$}03). Interpretation Subjectively assessed functional capacity should not be used for preoperative risk evaluation. Clinicians could instead consider a measure such as DASI for cardiac risk assessment.

  abstract = {Introduction Preoperative functional capacity is considered an important risk factor for cardiovascular and other complications of major non-cardiac surgery. Nonetheless, the usual approach for estimating preoperative functional capacity, namely doctors' subjective assessment, may not accurately predict postoperative morbidity or mortality. 3 possible alternatives are cardiopulmonary exercise testing; the Duke Activity Status Index, a standardised questionnaire for estimating functional capacity; and the serum concentration of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP), a biomarker for heart failure and cardiac ischaemia. Methods and analysis The Measurement of Exercise Tolerance before Surgery (METS) Study is a multicentre prospective cohort study of patients undergoing major elective non-cardiac surgery at 25 participating study sites in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK. We aim to recruit 1723 participants. Prior to surgery, participants undergo symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing on a cycle ergometer, complete the Duke Activity Status Index questionnaire, undergo blood sampling to measure serum NT pro-BNP concentration and have their functional capacity subjectively assessed by their responsible doctors. Participants are followed for 1 year after surgery to assess vital status, postoperative complications and general health utilities. The primary outcome is all-cause death or non-fatal myocardial infarction within 30 days after surgery, and the secondary outcome is all-cause death within 1 year after surgery. Both receiver-operating-characteristic curve methods and risk reclassification table methods will be used to compare the prognostic accuracy of preoperative subjective assessment, peak oxygen consumption during cardiopulmonary exercise testing, Duke Activity Status Index scores and serum NT pro-BNP concentration. Ethics and dissemination The METS Study has received research ethics board approval at all sites. Participant recruitment began in March 2013, and 1-year follow-up is expected to finish in 2016. Publication of the results of the METS Study is anticipated to occur in 2017.},

  abstract = {PurposeThis review discusses the utility of risk scores, specifically, the role of preoperative risk scores in guiding the management of surgical patients, approaches to evaluate the quality of risk scores, and limitations to consider when applying risk scores in clinical practice.Principal findingsThis review shows how accurate predictions of perioperative risk can help inform patients and clinicians with respect to decision-making around surgery; identify patients who warrant further specialized investigations, new interventions intended to decrease risk, modifications in planned operative procedures, or intensification of postoperative monitoring; and facilitate fairer comparisons of outcomes between providers and hospitals. A preoperative risk score formally integrates several pieces of clinical information (e.g., age, comorbid disease, laboratory tests) to arrive at an overall estimate of an individual patient's expected risk for specific postoperative adverse events. A good risk score should be simple to incorporate in clinical practice, reliable when applied by different raters, and accurate at predicting postoperative risk. Several analytical methods (e.g., receiver operating characteristic curves, likelihood ratios, risk reclassification tables, observed vs predicted plots) are required to characterize the relevant domains that encompass the prognostic accuracy of a risk score. External validation is critical in determining whether the predictive accuracy of a risk score is preserved when applied to new settings, populations, or outcome events.ConclusionsPreoperative risk scores help inform perioperative clinical decision-making. Future research must determine how estimates of preoperative risk can be updated with information from the intraoperative period, how risk information should be communicated to patients, and which interventions can improve outcomes among patients within newly identified risk strata.},

  abstract = {Background: Non-invasive ventilation is first-line treatment for patients with acutely decompensated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but endotracheal intubation, involving admission to an intensive care unit, may sometimes be required. Decisions to admit to an intensive care unit are commonly based on predicted survival and quality of life, but the information base for these decisions is limited and there is some evidence that clinicians tend to be pessimistic. This study examined the outcomes in patients with COPD admitted to the intensive care unit for decompensated type II respiratory failure. Methods: A prospective cohort study was carried out in 92 intensive care units and 3 respiratory high dependency units in the UK. Patients aged 45 years and older with breathlessness, respiratory failure or change in mental status due to an exacerbation of COPD, asthma or a combination of the two were recruited. Outcomes included survival and quality of life at 180 days. Results: Of the 832 patients recruited, 517 (62\%) survived to 180 days. Of the survivors, 421 (81\%) responded to a questionnaire. Of the respondents, 73\% considered their quality of life to be the same as or better than it had been in the stable period before they were admitted, and 96\% would choose similar treatment again. Function during the stable pre-admission period was a reasonable indicator of function reported by those who survived 180 days. Conclusions: Most patients with COPD who survive to 180 days after treatment in an intensive care unit have a heavy burden of symptoms, but almost all of them\textemdash including those who have been intubated\textemdash would want similar intensive care again under similar circumstances.},

Univariate analysis showed a significant correlation (P {$<$} 0.05) between ASA class and perioperative variables (intraoperative blood loss, duration of postoperative ventilation and duration of intensive care stay), postoperative complications and mortality rate. Univariate analysis of individual preoperative risk factors demonstrated their importance in the development of postoperative complications in the related organ systems. Estimating the increased risk odds ratio for single variables, we found that the risk of complication was influenced mainly by ASA class IV (risk odds ratio = 4.2) and ASA class III (risk odds ratio = 2.2).

We aimed to quantify adult ICU/high-dependency unit (ICU/HDU) capacity in hospitals from the UK, Australia, and New Zealand (NZ), and to identify and describe additional `high-acuity' beds capable of managing high-risk patients outside the ICU/HDU environment. Methods We used a modified Delphi consensus method to design a survey that was disseminated via investigator networks in the UK, Australia, and NZ. Hospital- and ward-level data were collected, including bed numbers, tertiary services offered, presence of an emergency department, ward staffing levels, and the availability of critical care facilities. Results We received responses from 257 UK (response rate: 97.7\%), 35 Australian (response rate: 32.7\%), and 17 NZ (response rate: 94.4\%) hospitals (total 309). Of these hospitals, 91.6\% reported on-site ICU or HDU facilities. UK hospitals reported fewer critical care beds per 100 hospital beds (median=2.7) compared with Australia (median=3.7) and NZ (median=3.5). Additionally, 31.1\% of hospitals reported having high-acuity beds to which high-risk patients were admitted for postoperative management, in addition to standard ICU/HDU facilities. The estimated numbers of critical care beds per 100 000 population were 9.3, 14.1, and 9.1 in the UK, Australia, and NZ, respectively. The estimated per capita high-acuity bed capacities per 100 000 population were 1.2, 3.8, and 6.4 in the UK, Australia, and NZ, respectively. Conclusions Postoperative critical care resources differ in the UK, Australia, and NZ. High-acuity beds may have developed to augment the capacity to deliver postoperative critical care.},

This study examines the preoperative and postoperative ability of the surgeon to predict complications and assesses the significance of a change in prediction.MethodsThis was a prospective study of 1013 patients. The surgeon assessed the risk of a major complication on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) immediately before and after surgery. When the VAS score was changed, the surgeon was asked to document why. Patients were assessed up to 30 days postoperatively.ResultsSurgeons made a meaningful preoperative prediction of major complications (median score = 27mm vs. 19mm, p {$<$} 0.01), with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.74 for mortality, 0.67 for major complications, and 0.63 for all complications. A change in the VAS score postoperatively was due to technical reasons in 74\% of stated cases. An increased VAS score identified significantly more complications, but the improvement in the discrimination was small. When included in a multivariate model for predicting postoperative complications, the surgeon's VAS score functioned as an independent predictive variable and improved the predictive ability, goodness of fit, and discrimination of the model.ConclusionsClinical assessment of risk by the surgeon using a VAS score independently improves the prediction of perioperative complications. Including the unique contribution of the surgeon's clinical assessment should be considered in models designed to predict the risk of surgery.},

  abstract = {Background. Although the risk factors that contribute to postoperative complications are well recognized, prediction in the context of a particular patient is more difficult. We were interested in using a visual analog scale (VAS) to capture surgeons' prediction of the risk of a major complication and to examine whether this could be improved. Methods. The study was performed in 3 stages. In phase I, the surgeon assessed the risk of a major complication on a 100-mm VAS immediately before and after surgery. A quality control questionnaire was designed to check if the VAS was being scored as a linear scale. In phase II, a VAS with 6 subscales for different areas of clinical risk was introduced. In phase III, predictions were completed following the presentation of detailed feedback on the accuracy of prediction of complications. Results. In total, 1295 predictions were made by 58 surgeons in 859 patients. Eight surgeons did not use a linear scale (6 logarithmic, 2 used 4 categories of risk). Surgeons made a meaningful prediction of major complications (preoperative median score 40 mm for complications v. 22 mm for no complication, P {$<$} 0.001; postoperative 46 mm v. 21 mm, P {$<$} 0.001). In phase I, the discrimination of prediction for preoperative (0.778), postoperative (0.810), and POSSUM (Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the Enumeration of Mortality and Morbidity) morbidity (0.750) prediction was similar. Although there was no improvement in prediction with a multidimensional VAS, there was a significant improvement in the discrimination of prediction after feedback (preoperative, 0.895; postoperative, 0.918). Conclusion. Awareness of different ways a VAS is scored is important when designing and interpreting studies. Clinical assessment of major complications by the surgeon was initially comparable to the prediction of the POSSUM morbidity score and improved significantly following the presentation of clinically relevant feedback.},

  abstract = {Large differences exist in the provision of ICU beds worldwide, with a complicated mix of risks and benefits to the population of having either too few or too many beds. Having too few beds can result in delayed admission of patients to the ICU or no admission at all, with either scenario potentially increasing mortality. Potential societal benefits of having few beds include lower costs for health care and less futile intensive care at the end of life. With added ICU beds for a population, mortality benefit should accrue, but there is still the question of whether the addition of beds always means that more lives will be saved or whether there is a point at which no additional mortality benefit is gained. With an abundance of ICU beds may come the possibility of increasing harm in the forms of unnecessary costs, poor quality of deaths (ie, excessively intensive), and iatrogenic complications. The possibility of harm may be likened to the concept of falling off a Starling curve, which is traditionally used to describe worsening heart function when overfilling occurs. This commentary examines the possible implications of having too few or too many ICU beds and proposes the concept of a family of Starling curves as a way to conceptualize the balance of societal benefits and harms associated with different availability of ICU beds for a population.},

METHODS: The authors examined frequency of admission to an ICU during the hospital stay for Medicare beneficiaries undergoing selected major surgical procedures: elective endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, cystectomy, pancreaticoduodenectomy, esophagectomy, and elective open AAA repair. The authors compared hospital mortality, length of stay, and Medicare payments for patients receiving each procedure in hospitals admitting patients to the ICU less than 50\% of the time (low use), 50 to 89\% (moderate use), and 90\% or greater (high use), adjusting for patient and hospital factors. RESULTS: The cohort ranged from 7,878 patients in 162 hospitals for esophagectomies to 69,989 patients in 866 hospitals for endovascular AAA. Overall admission to ICU ranged from 35.6\% (endovascular AAA) to 71.3\% (open AAA). Admission to ICU across hospitals ranged from less than 5\% to 100\% of patients for each surgical procedure. There was no association between hospital use of intensive care and mortality for any of the five surgical procedures. There was a consistent association between high use of intensive care with longer length of hospital stay and higher Medicare payments only for endovascular AAA. CONCLUSIONS: There is little consensus regarding the need for intensive care for patients undergoing major surgical procedures and no relationship between a hospital's use of intensive care and hospital mortality. There is also no consistent relationship across surgical procedures between use of intensive care and either length of hospital stay or payments for care.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Critical care represents a large percentage of healthcare spending in developed countries. Yet, little is known regarding international variation in critical care services. We sought to understand differences in critical care delivery by comparing data on the distribution of services in eight countries. DESIGN Retrospective review of existing national administrative data. We identified sources of data in each country to provide information on acute care hospitals and beds, intensive care units and beds, intensive care admissions, and definitions of intensive care beds. Data were all referenced and from as close to 2005 as possible. SETTING United States, France, United Kingdom, Canada, Belgium, Germany, The Netherlands, and Spain. PATIENTS Not available. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS No standard definition existed for acute care hospital or intensive care unit beds across countries. Hospital beds varied three-fold from 221/100,000 population in the United States to 593/100,000 in Germany. Adult intensive care unit beds also ranged seven-fold from 3.3/100,000 population in the United Kingdom to 24.0/100,000 in Germany. Volume of intensive care unit admissions per year varied ten-fold from 216/100,000 population in the United Kingdom to 2353/100,000 in Germany. The ratio of intensive care unit beds to hospital beds was highly correlated across all countries except the United States (r = .90). There was minimal correlation between the number of intensive care unit beds per capita and health care spending per capita (r = .45), but high inverse correlation between intensive care unit beds and hospital mortality for intensive care unit patients across countries (r = -.82). CONCLUSIONS Absolute critical care services vary dramatically between countries with wide differences in both numbers of beds and volume of admissions. The number of intensive care unit beds per capita is not strongly correlated with overall health expenditure, but does correlate strongly with mortality. These findings demonstrate the need for critical care data from all countries, as they are essential for interpretation of studies, and policy decisions regarding critical care services.},

  abstract = {Background Case cancellation (CC) has significant impact on the efficiency of operating room (OR) management, which can be mitigated by taking preventive measures. In this study, using the data of the West China Hospital (WCH), we identified the effect of contributing factors and recommended hospital interventions to facilitate CC prevention. Method We conducted a retrospective review of 11,331 elective surgical cases from January 1 to December 31, 2014. CC reasons were grouped into six categories. The methods of descriptive statistics and hypothesis test were used to identify the effect of factors. Results CC reasons (746) were divided into six broad categories: workup related (preoperative diagnostic assessment issues or sudden medical condition changes) (25.8\%), non-specified reasons (25.8\%), coordination issues (15.1\%), patient related (13.0\%), support system issues (11.8\%), and doctor related (8.5\%). The types of the most frequently performed operations are identified, as well as their CRs. The cancellation rate (CR) of males was lower than that of females (16.7\% to 18.3\%). A large difference in the CRs existed among doctors. The CR on Monday was significantly higher than the other four weekdays. Conclusions Workup related issues, the types of procedures, the menstrual cycle of females, highly imbalanced CRs among doctors, and tendency of cancellation on Monday are the major identified factors, which account for a significant amount of preventable cancellations. It is suggested that corresponding hospital interventions can reduce CR and improve OR efficiency, including maintaining effective coordination, good communication and well-designed preoperative assessment processes, focusing on the type of procedures which are more time-consuming and complex, paying special attention to the physiology of females during surgery planning, taking measures to reduce CR of top eight doctors, and improving surgery scheduling on Monday.},

  abstract = {Background: Several societies around the world issue guidelines incorporating the latest evidence. However, even the most commonly cited guidelines of the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA) leave the clinician with several treatment options and differ on specific points. We aimed to identify discrepancies and areas of consensus between guidelines to give novel insights into areas where low consensus between the guideline panels exists, and therefore where more evidence might increase consensus. Methods: The webpages of the 61 members of the Societ\'e Internationale d'Urologie were analysed to identify all listed or linked guidelines. Decision trees for the surgical management of urolithiasis were derived, and a comparative analysis was performed to determine consensus and discrepancies. Results: Five national and one international guideline (EAU) on surgical stone treatment were available for analysis. While 7 national urological societies refer to the AUA guidelines and 11 to the EAU guidelines, 43 neither publish their own guidelines nor refer to others. Comparative analysis revealed a high degree of consensus for most renal and ureteral stone scenarios. Nevertheless, we also identified a variety of discrepancies between the different guidelines, the largest being the approach to the treatment of proximal ureteral calculi and larger renal calculi. Conclusions: Six guidelines with recommendations for the surgical treatment of urolithiasis to support urologists in decision-making were available for inclusion in our analysis. While there is a high grade of consensus for most stone scenarios, we also detected some discrepancies between different guidelines. These are, however, controversial situations where adequate evidence to assist with decision-making has yet to be elicited by further research.},
