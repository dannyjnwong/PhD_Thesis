# Overview of The Second Sprint National Anaesthesia Project {#methods}

In *Chapter 1*, the issue of misallocation of critical care resources for patients at high risk of mortality following surgery was raised, and some possible explanations of this observation were proposed. A number of research questions were raised which are being examined in this thesis. In this chapter, I outline a series of studies which together comprise the body of evidence I will use to answer these research questions. A summary of the aims and objectives of each study will be provided, and common elements to study delivery will be described in this chapter. Further details of the methodology of each study will be described in later chapters.

These studies together form a part of the Second Sprint National Anaesthesia Project: EPIdemiology of Critical Care provision after Surgery (SNAP-2: EPICCS), a prospective observational cohort study which enrolled patients in 2017 [@moonesinghe_snap-2_2017; @wong_cancelled_2018]. The overall methodology of SNAP-2: EPICCS has previously been published [@moonesinghe_snap-2_2017; @wong_cancelled_2018], and will be summarised here. In brief, the SNAPs are short-term observational studies of patient-centred outcomes[^SNAP-1], which receive support and endorsement of the National Institute of Academic Anaesthesia Health Services Research Centre (NIAA HSRC) and its parent organisation, the Royal College of Anaesthesists (RCoA) [@niaa_hsrc_next_2017]. The SNAPs aim to encompass 100% participation of eligible National Health Service (NHS) hospitals, and have substantial support from frontline NHS anaesthetists in their delivery through a network of Quality Audit and Research Coordinators (QuARCs[^QuARCs]). The work done in this PhD was performed as part of the second SNAP project. In addition to the UK sites which participated in the first SNAP, SNAP-2 sought the participation of sites in Australia and New Zealand to provide internationally generalisable data for inference.

[^SNAP-1]: The previous project in the programme, the First Sprint National Anaesthesia Project (SNAP-1), was a two-day cross-sectional observational study of patient reported outcomes after anaesthesia [@walker_patient_2016]. Although SNAP-1 and SNAP-2 share similar names, and utilise similar study support and infrastructure through the NIAA HSRC to collect data, both look at different aspects of perioperative anaesthesia care and seek to answer different scientific questions.

[^QuARCs]: The QuARCs are active and engaged anaesthetists who serve as the NIAA HSRC's contact points in the hospitals they work for facilitating national audits, quality improvement projects, and multi-centre research. This network was established in 2013, and has representation in almost all UK NHS hospitals (https://www.niaa-hsrc.org.uk/QUARCs). Further details of the QuARC network is discussed later in this chapter.

In order to answer the questions described in the previous section, SNAP-2: EPICCS aimed to accomplish the following objectives:

1. Collect organisational data on the critical care facilities in hospitals providing inpatient surgical care, and describe the current provision of critical care for postoperative patients, including care provided in high-acuity and enhanced care ward areas, in the UK, Australia and New Zealand (mapped to Research Question 1).
2. Collect preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data on all patients undergoing inpatient surgery for consecutive 7-day periods in UK NHS, Australian, and New Zealand public hospitals. Clinical teams would further be asked to provide a clinical estimate of patient risks of mortality prior to surgery, which would be compared to the estimates obtained using risk prediction tools and to real patient outcomes (mapped to Research Question 2). 
3. Use the patient-level data collected to compute estimates of perioperative risk using previously validated risk-prediction tools, thus determining their calibration and discrimination for risk-prediction, as well as comment on the generalisability of these models in international populations (mapped to Research Question 3).
4. Model the likelihood of patient admission to postoperative critical care using multilevel regression and propensity score models on patient- and hospital-level variables as predictors, and explore the effects of critical care capacity at the time of surgery as an instrumental variable (mapped to Research Questions 4 and 5).

With these objectives in mind the project comprised 3 parts:

- **Part 1** &mdash; A cross-sectional survey (organisational survey) of critical care facilities in participating hospitals.
- **Part 2** &mdash; Recruitment of a cohort of patients undergoing inpatient surgery during 1 week of clinical activity in participating hospitals.
- **Part 3** &mdash; A cross-sectional survey of clinician perceptions to perioperative critical care (not included in this thesis).

For the purposes of this thesis, I use data from Parts 1 and 2. Part 3 is beyond the scope of the research questions that will be examined in this thesis, and therefore will be briefly described in the concluding chapter when discussing future research work to follow on from this PhD.

In the following sections, I will provide an overview of the general organisation, governance and management of the SNAP-2: EPICCS study infrastructure. Methodological details and results of the organisational survey (Part 1) will then be presented in *Chapter 3*. The details of the methods for the patient cohort study will be presented in *Chapter 4*, and results of the cohort study will be presented in the *Chapters 5* to *7*. 

## Research governance considerations

The data collection for SNAP-2: EPICCS involved patients in each of the 4 devolved health authorities of the UK, and therefore was subject to research governance requirements for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Organisational Survey did not collect any patient-level data, and therefore was not subject to ethics approval.

### Cohort study ethical considerations

For patients enrolled into the inpatient surgical cohort, patient consent was not sought, instead I obtained support from the Confidentiality Advisory Group (CAG) for exemption under Section 251 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 as the legal basis to collect patient data without consent. It was important to the methodology of this study that all potential patient participants were included, in order to reduce the risk of selection bias affecting analyses. For example, emergency surgical patients or elderly patients with cognitive impairment may be too unwell to provide informed consent. However, these are the patients who may be most likely to see a benefit from postoperative critical care admission, hence, to exclude them from our study would introduce significant bias. Furthermore, this is an observational study where patients would not be subject to any additional interventions other than usual medical care. Data collected included some patient identifiable information (hospital number, date of birth, sex, postcode, place of residence) which were stored confidentially and pseudonymised on entering into a secure online database (data flows are discussed in greater detail below). Information about the study was prominently advertised using posters in patient areas of the hospitals participating in the study, and patients were given the opportunity to opt out of participating through either contacting the central project team, notifying their local caregivers, or discussing with the local investigators.

> For England and Wales, Health Research Authority Research Ethics Committee (REC) support was applied for (South Central - Berkshire B Research Ethics Committee, REC reference: 16/SC/0349; IRAS project ID: 154486), and approval was granted on 29 July 2016. A further application to the CAG was also made (CAG reference: 16/CAG/0087), and final CAG support was granted on 16 September 2016.
>
> For Scotland, Public Benefit and Privacy Panel for Health and Social Care support was applied for (NHSCR Ref: SR230; PBPP Ref: 1617-0126), and approval was granted on 19 December 2016. Individual NHS/HSC Site Specific Information (SSI) forms were submitted to individual NHS Scotland Health Boards and approvals were granted for each Health Board prior to study commencement.
> 
> For Wales, HRA approvals for England were transmitted to Health and Care Research Wales, which disseminated these to individual hospital sites, separate SSI forms were submitted for each Welsh Health Board participating in the study, approvals were then granted for each Health Board.
>
> For Northern Ireland, SSI forms were submitted to each participating Health and Social Care Trust, and approvals were granted for each Trust individually.
> 
> For Australia and New Zealand, individual hospital institutional research ethics and governance approvals were obtained for conducting the study at each site.

The SNAP-2: EPICCS project was adopted onto the NIHR CRN[^NIHRCRN] Portfolio (CPMS ID: 31913) in the UK.

After governance approvals were granted, one minor and two substantial amendments were made to the study protocol and documents in the UK, following issues identified in the pilot study conducted in January 2017. Individual institutional research and development department approvals were separately obtained for sites in Australia and New Zealand, after patient recruitment ended in the UK by collaborators situated at each hospital.

[^NIHRCRN]: The National Institute of Health Research Clinical Research Network (NIHR CRN) provides _"infrastructure support for the initiation and delivery of high quality research which benefits patients and the NHS, including relevant research in public health and social care"_ [@nihr_clinical_research_network_eligibility_2017] The support provided includes access to Network-funded research delivery staff at individual NHS sites participating in studies, e.g. research nurses and administrative staff.

## Data security, handling, electronic Case Record Forms and data flow

For the Organisational Survey, data collection was primarily performed via online forms (FormAssembly, Veer West LLC, Bloomington, Indiana, USA), as no personally identifiable data was being collected.

In England, Scotland, Wales, Australia and New Zealand, data for the patient cohort were first collected on paper CRFs before being transcribed onto electronic CRFs via a dedicated, secure online webtool, with the data stored on a secure database (Figure 2-1). Completed paper CRFs were held in secure locations accessible by the local collaborators in accordance with GCP guidelines and local information and research governance frameworks. 

![Figure 2-1: Webtool and database screenshot. Patient cohort study data was collected and submitted via a secure online webtool to the study database hosted within the Royal College of Anaesthetists. (A) shows an overview of all cases from each site. (B) shows an example Case Record Form (CRF) for an individual patient included in the study. Each CRF was divided into sections with coloured bars at the top of each section indicating whether the sections were completed (green), incomplete (amber), erroneous (red), or empty and unsaved (blue). Within the site overview page of the webtool, users were able to identify CRFs with incomplete or erroneous fields at a glance by seeing the coloured bars on the right of each row. Identifiable and confidential information has been pixellated in this illustration.](figures/Webtool_Screenshot.png)

The webtool and database were developed in partnership with Net Solving Ltd. (www.netsolving.com), an external software vendor, according to study specifications. During the design of the study, I met regularly with Net Solving Ltd. representatives to test the electronic CRFs before they were used in the study. Collaborators accessed the webtool via internet browsers at this web address: https://snap2.snapresearch.org.uk/. The database is hosted on servers managed by the Royal College of Anaesthetists outsourced to UK Fast Net Ltd. (https://www.ukfast.co.uk/).

Access to the webtool was limited to study collaborators with password-protected user accounts and encrypted server connections using Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). Data entry errors were minimised through field-level validation rules (e.g. only accepting integers &ge;3 and &le; 15 for Glasgow Coma Scale, correctly-formatted dates for dates of birth, etc.), and section-level validation (sections with incomplete or erroneous fields were flagged up accordingly to the user). Records with complete data could be locked to prevent further alteration. Incomplete records could still be saved but incomplete fields would be highlighted to the user and the Central Project Team. Directly identifiable patient information such as names, dates of birth, postcodes and hospital identification numbers were recorded but only visible to users at each site, but were masked from the Central Project Team, who could only refer to records via their assigned study identification numbers (Case ID).

The webtool and database remained open to data entry from Tuesday 21 March 2017 to Monday 31 August 2017 in the UK, from Wednesday 21 June 2017 to Wednesday 25 October 2017 in Australia, and from Wednesday 30 August 2017 to Monday 4 December 2017 in New Zealand, to allow sites sufficient time to transfer data from their paper CRFs onto electronic CRFs. 

In Northern Ireland, patient-level data was collected on paper CRFs, and then transcribed onto a validated Microsoft Excel spreadsheet template by the local investigators. Directly identifiable patient information was then removed from the spreadsheets and then electronically transmitted to the RCoA for aggregation. The data from Northern Ireland was then combined into a single table with the data from the rest of the UK before analysis. This additional step for Northern Ireland data was necessary as research governance restrictions prevented the transmission of patient identifiable information to bodies outside of their jurisdiction, and research governance approvals were not granted for participating sites to use the online webtool that sites in England, Scotland and Wales used. 

The electronic patient datasets were appropriately exported without directly identifiable patient information for analysis; the RCoA served as the data controlling organisation for the study, with Ms Sharon Drake (Director of Clinical Quality and Research and Deputy Chief Executive, RCoA) as the designated responsible person. 

As the data controller, the RCoA has policies which govern data processing, storage and disposal of all participant datasets, which are compliant with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements, including the Data Protection Act 1998 and any other statutory requirements. The RCoA is registered with the Information Commissioner's Office (Data Protection Registration Number: Z7495398).

In order to facilitate future data-linkage with NHS Digital held national registry data for the subset of the patient cohort within England, a minimum amount of patient identifiable data will be extracted from the study database by the central investigation team, onto a password protected Excel spreadsheet, and emailed securely to the NHS Digital, to facilitate linkage to central held mortality data. Mortality will be tracked for all patients with a final censure date of 10 years after participant recruitment. Analyses relying on data-linkage fall outside the scope of this PhD thesis, but have been mentioned to inform the reader about the wider context to which this PhD research relates, as well as to illustrate the considered approach that has been taken with data privacy, governance and security throughout SNAP-2: EPICCS.

A diagram of the data flow is illustrated in Figure 2-2.

## Study delivery infrastructure

SNAP-2: EPICCS had an ambitious scope and aimed for inclusive coverage of the majority of eligible NHS hospitals across the UK, and a representative sample of publicly-funded Australian and New Zealand hospitals. Managing a project of this scale required a decentralised collaborative structure for delivery. Figure 2-3 illustrates the infrastructure that facilitated participant recruitment and data collection in the UK. Further details about the constituent members of the Central Project Team and Study Steering Group are described in the following sections.

Ethical and research governance approvals were led by me in the UK through the Health Research Authority (HRA) Integrated Research Application System (IRAS) research approvals process, and governance approval documents were then forwarded to collaborators in Australia and New Zealand. The study was conducted in UK NHS hospitals first, with patient recruitment completing in March 2017, before recruitment was commenced in Australia (recruitment completing in June 2017) and New Zealand (recruitment completing in September 2017). Conduct of the study in Australian and New Zealand hospitals was delegated to a team led by research collaborators who liaised closely with me and the Central Project Team in the UK, and utilised existing research network infrastructure in their countries which were similar to those used in the UK (Figure 2-4).

Table: Table 2-1: Roles of the central project team.

### Study Steering Group

A steering group was convened, comprising experts from multiple bodies (including representatives from the Royal College of Anaesthetists, Royal College of Surgeons and external universities). These representatives were nominated by their parent organisations, which were formally invited to participate in the conduct of SNAP-2: EPICCS. The parent organisations were identified as potential stakeholders in the research, with established interests in the care of patients at and around the time of surgery. 

The steering group reviewed all aspects of the conduct of the study, and provided external expert guidance on SNAP-2: EPICCS overall. It met quarterly (both face-to-face meetings and teleconferences) from September 2015 to March 2017 to discuss the planning and running of the study. After data collection completed, the steering group continued to meet on an *ad hoc* basis, depending on need. The steering group was chaired by Professor Mike Grocott, previous Director of the National Institute of Academic Anaesthesia Health Services Research Centre, and currently Professor of Anaesthesia and Critical Care Medicine at the University of Southampton.

Representatives from the following organisations sat on the steering group:

1. Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCoA): Dr Robert Sneyd (Council Member), Ms Sharon Drake (Director of Clinical Quality & Research)
2. Intensive Care Society (ICS): Professor Stephen Brett (Previous President)
3. Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine (FICM): Dr Anna Batchelor (Previous Dean)
4. Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGBI): Dr Mike Nathanson
5. Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCS[Eng]): Dr Shafi Ahmed
6. UK Critical Care Nursing Alliance: Ms Catherine Plowright
7. Royal College of Nursing (RCN) Critical Care Forum: Mr Suman Shrestha
8. Patient/Lay representation: Mr Richard Shawyer

The central project team reported monthly to the Board of the National Institute for Academic Anaesthesia's Health Services Research Centre (NIAA HSRC) based at the Royal College of Anaesthetists.

Project team minutes were reviewed by the NIAA HSRC monthly and the steering group quarterly.

### Research Networks and the Royal College of Anaesthetists

The [Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCoA)](https://www.rcoa.ac.uk/) is the central body for Anaesthetists in the UK. Membership and fellowship of the college is compulsory for trainees and consultants, and therefore almost all anaesthetists in the UK receive the communications issued by the college, in the form of: a) the [Bulletin](https://www.rcoa.ac.uk/bulletin), a printed publication that is delivered to all members; b) college emails; c) communications through various sub-committees and working parties within the college, such as the College Tutors network. In effect, the College's communications machinery can be mobilised to help encourage participation in big national studies of interests to all anaesthetists.

Together with the Chief Investigator, I wrote and published 2 articles for the RCoA Bulletin which were disseminated to all members of the RCoA outlining the study and motivations behind it, asking for member support [@wong_2nd_2016; @wong_snap-2:_2017]. The first was published over a year before the study was due to launch and the second was published at the start of the month of patient recruitment.

The study utilised research collaborator groups that have been developed over the years by the NIAA HSRC. These groups of collaborators could be thought of as 3 overlapping networks, and allowed access into almost all the UK NHS hospitals where Consultant Anaesthetists, Trainees and National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) clinical research staff worked.

1. **The Quality Audit and Research Coordinators (QuARCs)** &mdash; Over 90% of the hospitals in the UK employ anaesthetic consultants who have volunteered to be [QuARCs](https://www.niaa-hsrc.org.uk/QUARCs?newsid=584). They serve as a single point of contact for the NIAA HSRC to reach into sites for conducting research. QuARCs have now been involved in a number of studies and therefore have built-up substantial experience in local data collection and developed relationships within their departments and with other departments to help facilitate research.
2. **Trainee Research Networks** &mdash; The UK now has a very sophisticated infrastructure of 14 trainee research networks, which cover virtually all regions, and sit beneath a national coordinating body called the [Research & Audit Federation of Trainees (RAFT)](http://www.raftrainees.com/). They promote a collaborative approach to research and offer junior anaesthetists and trainees the opportunity to contribute to research on the principle that the cumulative contribution of many individuals results in larger, more generalisable research outputs.
3. **The National Institute of Health Research Clinical Research Networks (NIHR CRN)** &mdash; The [NIHR CRN](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/about-us/how-we-are-managed/managing-centres/crn/) is a UK Department of Health funded organisation that exists to help support and fund common research assets (equipment and personnel). The NIAA HSRC is a partner organisation with the NIHR and therefore studies it coordinates are eligible for NIHR CRN support.
4. **Hospital Research & Development Departments and Research Support Staff** &mdash; A large multidisciplinary study requires many individuals working together from different hospital departments, including nurses, doctors and clinical research administrators from Anaesthesia, Intensive Care Medicine, Surgery and so on. Many clinicians work within their own departments of the hospital and may lack familiarity with other hospital departments. The study harnessed the expertise that existed within each hospitals' R&D departments to enable cross-departmental working. Research administrators, research nurses and research support workers who are used to conducting studies, and used to completing the necessary regulatory and governance documentation were involved early in the study process. Contact was made with each hospitals' R&D departments a few months before the study was due to launch, and QuARCs were also encouraged to liaise early with R&D departments.

### Australian and New Zealand Collaborators

Collaborators in Australia and New Zealand were guided by the UK Central Project Team with regards to study procedures, but were given autonomy to organise and coordinate the research networks within their countries to deliver the study. The members of the Australian and New Zealand project team and their roles are summarised in Table 2-2.

| Individual        | Role          | 
| :---------------- |:--------------|
| Prof PS. Myles    | Senior lead investigator for Australia, member of the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists Clinical Trials Network (ANZCA CTN) Executive Board, provided supervisory support to Dr S. Popham, and liaised with ANZCA CTN members. |
| Dr S. Popham      | Lead anaesthetic trainee investigator for Australia, chair of the Trainee Members Group of the Australian Society of Anaesthetists, liaised with site Principal Investigators and members of the Australian Society of Anaesthetists.|
| Ms S. Wallace     | Administrative support for Australia (e.g. recording all collaborators' details, printing and distributing Case Record Forms, recording and administering to site Research and Development Department approvals, etc.). |
| Dr HA. Lindsay & Dr D. Campbell | Senior co-lead investigators for New Zealand, provided supervisory support to Dr AM. Wilson and Dr LM. Barneto. |
| Dr AM. Wilson & Dr LM. Barneto  | Co-lead anaesthetic trainee investigators for New Zealand, liaised and coordinated the New Zealand study with site Principal Investigators via the Supportive Anaesthesia Trainee aUdit & Research Network for NZ (SATURN)|

Table: Table 2-2: Roles of the Australian and New Zealand project team.

## Potential strengths and limitations of the SNAPs

The strengths of the SNAPs are the widespread participation of frontline clinical staff across the whole spectrum of available clinical work, with near complete capture of all clinical activity within the UK NHS, thus adding to the generalisability of findings. However, limitations of the SNAP approach are firstly, the cross-sectional nature of data capture, which necessitate that the timeframe of data sampling is relatively short, in order to minimise participant fatigue; secondly, reliance on clinical staff unused to research participation to perform data collection.

## A note on statistical analyses

For all statistical analyses in this thesis, `r version$version.string` (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used with a number of external packages enabled. A full list of the external packages used for analysis is included in *Appendix 7*.

## Conclusion

In this section, I have introduced a synopsis of the SNAP-2: EPICCS project which provide the data to approach the research questions laid out in this PhD research. The overall aims and objectives of SNAP-2: EPICCS and the component parts of the study have been presented. Details of research governance and study management have also been described. 

SNAP-2: EPICCS comprised a wide-ranging research programme with a number of parts, of which two are relevant to the scope of this PhD thesis. In the subsequent chapters, I will present the relevant findings of analyses performed on data from Parts 1 and 2 of SNAP-2: EPICCS to answer the research questions presented in *Chapter 1*.
